2
00:02:56,846 --> 00:02:59,176
This will begin to make things right.

3
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:03,096
I've traveled too far and seen too much

4
00:03:03,176 --> 00:03:06,146
to ignore the despair in the galaxy.

5
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:10,106
Without the Jedi, there can be
no balance in the Force.

6
00:03:10,936 --> 00:03:13,486
Well, because of you,
now we have a chance.

7
00:03:13,606 --> 00:03:15,356
The General's been after this
for a long time.

8
00:03:15,816 --> 00:03:17,236
Oh, the General?

9
00:03:17,316 --> 00:03:19,696
To me, she is royalty.

10
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,696
Well, she certainly is that.

11
00:03:27,536 --> 00:03:28,706
We got company.

12
00:03:41,766 --> 00:03:43,306
You have to hide.

13
00:03:43,426 --> 00:03:44,846
You have to leave.

14
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:47,976
Go.

15
00:04:19,336 --> 00:04:21,676
Come on, BB-8, hurry!

16
00:04:33,936 --> 00:04:35,066
<i>Blast thatX-wing!</i>

17
00:04:35,146 --> 00:04:36,316
<i>Over there! Over there!</i>

18
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:43,446
I see them.

19
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:16,026
You take this.

20
00:05:16,106 --> 00:05:18,066
It's safer with you than it is with me.

21
00:05:18,896 --> 00:05:21,026
You get as far away from here
as you can.

22
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,906
Do you hear me?

23
00:05:24,026 --> 00:05:25,406
I'll come back for you.

24
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,446
It will be all right.

25
00:06:26,506 --> 00:06:27,806
<i>Keep moving!</i>

26
00:06:29,966 --> 00:06:31,306
<i>Stay here.</i>

27
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,586
<i>Look how old you've become.</i>

28
00:06:58,246 --> 00:07:01,206
Something far worse
has happened to you.

29
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:04,006
<i>You know what I've come for.</i>

30
00:07:04,376 --> 00:07:06,296
I know where you come from.

31
00:07:06,386 --> 00:07:08,346
Before you called yourself Kylo Ren.

32
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:12,426
<i>The map to Skywalker.
We know you found it.</i>

33
00:07:13,596 --> 00:07:16,346
<i>And now you're going
to give it to the First Order.</i>

34
00:07:16,476 --> 00:07:18,936
The First Order rose from the dark side.

35
00:07:19,016 --> 00:07:20,016
You did not.

36
00:07:21,186 --> 00:07:23,696
<i>I'll show you the dark side.</i>

37
00:07:24,356 --> 00:07:26,026
You may try.

38
00:07:26,106 --> 00:07:30,116
But you cannot deny
the truth that is your family.

39
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:31,906
<i>You're so right.</i>

40
00:08:05,946 --> 00:08:08,236
So, who talks first?
You talk first? I talk first?

41
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,276
<i>The old man gave it to you.</i>

42
00:08:11,446 --> 00:08:13,036
It's just very hard to
understand you with all the...

43
00:08:13,116 --> 00:08:14,746
<i>- Search him.</i>
- ...apparatus.

44
00:08:18,786 --> 00:08:20,666
<i>- Nothing, sir.</i>
<i>- Put him on board.</i>

45
00:08:26,796 --> 00:08:29,296
<i>Sir, the villagers?</i>

46
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,096
<i>Kill them all.</i>

47
00:08:34,596 --> 00:08:36,176
<i>On my command.</i>

48
00:08:37,136 --> 00:08:38,516
<i>Fire.</i>

49
00:08:38,596 --> 00:08:40,606
Please, no!

50
00:09:09,086 --> 00:09:10,886
<i>Nothing here.
Go ahead!</i>

51
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:53,006
All right.

52
00:09:53,086 --> 00:09:54,096
All right!

53
00:10:19,996 --> 00:10:21,706
<i>FN-218</i>7.

54
00:10:22,366 --> 00:10:24,876
<i>Submit your blaster for inspection.</i>

55
00:10:25,536 --> 00:10:26,786
Yes, Captain.

56
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:30,046
<i>And who gave you permission
to remove that helmet?</i>

57
00:10:30,716 --> 00:10:31,716
I'm sorry, Captain.

58
00:10:31,796 --> 00:10:33,886
<i>Report to my division at once.</i>

59
00:13:19,586 --> 00:13:22,846
What you brought
me today is worth...

60
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:24,636
hmm...

61
00:13:25,886 --> 00:13:28,676
one quarter portion.

62
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,346
Shh.

63
00:15:30,386 --> 00:15:32,676
That's just Teedo. Wants you for parts.

64
00:15:33,386 --> 00:15:34,976
He has no respect for anyone.

65
00:15:38,686 --> 00:15:39,766
Your antenna's bent.

66
00:15:49,526 --> 00:15:50,576
Where do you come from?

67
00:15:54,366 --> 00:15:56,166
Classified, really?

68
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,536
Me too. Big secret.

69
00:15:58,456 --> 00:16:01,546
Niima Outpost is that way.
Stay off Kelvin Ridge.

70
00:16:01,706 --> 00:16:03,506
Keep away from
the Sinking Fields in the north.

71
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,086
You'll drown in the sand.

72
00:16:10,426 --> 00:16:13,306
Don't follow me. Town is that way.

73
00:16:16,516 --> 00:16:17,516
No!

74
00:16:33,906 --> 00:16:35,536
In the morning, you go.

75
00:16:41,336 --> 00:16:42,456
You're welcome.

76
00:16:54,176 --> 00:16:55,426
<i>I had no idea we had...</i>

77
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:58,266
<i>the best pilot in
the Resistance on board.</i>

78
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,686
<i>Comfortable?</i>

79
00:17:02,266 --> 00:17:03,266
Not really.

80
00:17:04,726 --> 00:17:06,026
<i>I'm impressed.</i>

81
00:17:08,526 --> 00:17:10,236
<i>No one has been able to
get out of you...</i>

82
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,826
<i>what you did with the map.</i>

83
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:16,656
You might want to rethink
your technique.

84
00:17:32,136 --> 00:17:34,466
<i>Where is it?</i>

85
00:17:36,426 --> 00:17:38,056
The Resistance...

86
00:17:38,136 --> 00:17:40,136
will not be intimidated by you.

87
00:17:44,316 --> 00:17:47,106
<i>Where... is it?</i>

88
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,826
<i>It's in a droid. A BB unit.</i>

89
00:17:59,906 --> 00:18:02,366
Well, then, if it's on Jakku,
we'll soon have it.

90
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,126
<i>I leave that to you.</i>

91
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:08,956
Don't give up hope.
He still might show up.

92
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,176
Whoever it is you're waiting for.

93
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,716
Classified.

94
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,466
I know all about waiting.

95
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,516
For my family.

96
00:18:19,176 --> 00:18:21,936
They'll be back. One day.

97
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:23,726
Come on.

98
00:18:26,726 --> 00:18:29,896
<i>These five pieces are worth...</i>

99
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:32,856
Let me see here... hmm...

100
00:18:33,236 --> 00:18:35,946
one half portion.

101
00:18:36,026 --> 00:18:37,736
Last week they were a half portion each.

102
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,536
What about the droid?

103
00:18:42,366 --> 00:18:43,416
What about him?

104
00:18:43,536 --> 00:18:45,706
I'll pay for him.

105
00:18:51,586 --> 00:18:53,876
Sixty portions.

106
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:06,896
Actually...

107
00:19:08,896 --> 00:19:10,816
The droid's not for sale.

108
00:19:13,146 --> 00:19:14,146
Come on.

109
00:19:18,446 --> 00:19:20,826
Follow the girl and get that droid.

110
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,126
<i>Ren wants the prisoner.</i>

111
00:19:35,506 --> 00:19:36,636
<i>Turn here.</i>

112
00:19:38,596 --> 00:19:39,596
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

113
00:19:39,676 --> 00:19:41,926
<i>If you do exactly as I say,
I can get you out of here.</i>

114
00:19:42,016 --> 00:19:43,016
What?

115
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,346
This is a rescue. I'm helping you escape.

116
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:48,186
Can you fly a TIE fighter?

117
00:19:48,266 --> 00:19:49,316
You're with the Resistance?

118
00:19:49,436 --> 00:19:51,356
What? No, no, no. I'm breaking you out.

119
00:19:51,436 --> 00:19:53,436
- Can you fly a TIE fighter?
- I can fly anything.

120
00:19:54,186 --> 00:19:56,776
Why? Why are you helping me?

121
00:19:58,156 --> 00:19:59,866
Because it's the right thing to do.

122
00:20:00,776 --> 00:20:01,826
You need a pilot.

123
00:20:01,946 --> 00:20:03,286
I need a pilot.

124
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:05,866
We're gonna do this.

125
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:07,206
Yeah?

126
00:20:11,496 --> 00:20:13,706
<i>Okay. Stay calm. Stay calm.</i>

127
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,296
- I am calm.
<i>- I'm talking to myself.</i>

128
00:20:18,796 --> 00:20:19,796
<i>Not yet.</i>

129
00:20:21,676 --> 00:20:23,386
<i>Okay, go. This way.</i>

130
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,726
I've always wanted to fly
one of these things.

131
00:20:31,816 --> 00:20:33,896
- Can you shoot?
- Blasters, I can.

132
00:20:33,976 --> 00:20:35,316
Okay, same principle.

133
00:20:35,396 --> 00:20:36,396
Use the toggle on the left...

134
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,156
to switch between missiles,
cannons and mag pulse.

135
00:20:38,276 --> 00:20:39,696
Use the sight on the right to aim.

136
00:20:40,116 --> 00:20:41,906
- Triggers to fire.
- This is very complicated.

137
00:20:48,496 --> 00:20:49,576
I can fix this.

138
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,416
We have an unsanctioned
departure from bay two.

139
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:58,256
Alert General Hux. And stop that fighter.

140
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:20,026
Fourteen failed. Eighteen...

141
00:21:22,116 --> 00:21:23,196
I got it.

142
00:21:27,116 --> 00:21:28,656
This thing really moves.

143
00:21:33,246 --> 00:21:35,416
We gotta take out as many of
these cannons as we can...

144
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:36,626
or we're not gonna get very far.

145
00:21:36,706 --> 00:21:38,126
- All right.
- I'm gonna get us in position.

146
00:21:38,216 --> 00:21:39,216
Just stay sharp.

147
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,006
Up ahead! Up ahead! You see it?

148
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:45,136
I got us dead center.

149
00:21:45,216 --> 00:21:46,346
- It's a clean shot.
- Okay, got it.

150
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:56,526
- Yeah!
- Yes!

151
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:57,686
Did you see that?

152
00:21:57,776 --> 00:21:59,396
- Did you see that?
- I saw it!

153
00:22:05,076 --> 00:22:06,196
Hey, what's your name?

154
00:22:06,286 --> 00:22:07,536
FN-2187.

155
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,826
F... What?

156
00:22:08,906 --> 00:22:10,746
That's the only name they ever gave me.

157
00:22:10,866 --> 00:22:13,326
Well, I ain't using it. F-N, huh?

158
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:14,916
Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn.

159
00:22:14,996 --> 00:22:16,626
- Is that all right?
- Finn.

160
00:22:16,706 --> 00:22:18,376
Yeah. Finn, I like that.

161
00:22:18,456 --> 00:22:20,626
- I like that.
- I'm Poe. Poe Dameron.

162
00:22:20,716 --> 00:22:22,626
- Good to meet you, Poe.
- Good to meet you too, Finn.

163
00:22:26,216 --> 00:22:28,636
Sir, they've
taken out our turbolasers.

164
00:22:29,426 --> 00:22:30,806
Use the ventral cannons.

165
00:22:31,136 --> 00:22:33,056
Yes, sir. Bringing them online.

166
00:22:33,146 --> 00:22:35,856
<i>General Hux,
is it the Resistance pilot?</i>

167
00:22:35,936 --> 00:22:38,356
Yes, and he had help...

168
00:22:38,436 --> 00:22:39,816
from one of our own.

169
00:22:40,606 --> 00:22:41,816
We're checking the registers now...

170
00:22:41,946 --> 00:22:43,816
to identify which stormtrooper it was.

171
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:47,326
<i>The one from the village. FN-218</i>7.

172
00:22:47,946 --> 00:22:49,746
Sir, ventral cannons hot.

173
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:51,286
Fire.

174
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:02,336
One's coming toward you!
My right. Your left.

175
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:04,176
- Do you see it?
- Hold on.

176
00:23:04,296 --> 00:23:05,296
I see him!

177
00:23:08,676 --> 00:23:10,176
Nice shot!

178
00:23:16,516 --> 00:23:17,606
Where are we going?

179
00:23:17,726 --> 00:23:18,856
We're going back to Jakku.
That's where.

180
00:23:18,976 --> 00:23:20,526
No. We can't go back to Jakku.

181
00:23:20,606 --> 00:23:22,066
We need to get out of this system.

182
00:23:22,146 --> 00:23:24,026
I gotta get my droid
before the First Order does.

183
00:23:24,146 --> 00:23:25,406
- What, a droid?
- That's right.

184
00:23:25,486 --> 00:23:27,696
He's a BB unit, orange and
white. One of a kind.

185
00:23:27,826 --> 00:23:28,826
I don't care what color he is!

186
00:23:28,906 --> 00:23:30,156
No droid can be that important.

187
00:23:30,236 --> 00:23:31,246
This one is, pal!

188
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,996
We gotta get as far away from
the First Order as we can.

189
00:23:33,116 --> 00:23:34,406
We go back to Jakku, we die.

190
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:37,206
That droid has a map
that leads straight to Luke Skywalker.

191
00:23:37,286 --> 00:23:39,206
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

192
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:45,376
<i>FN-218</i>7 <i>reported
to my division...</i>

193
00:23:45,506 --> 00:23:47,796
<i>was evaluated,
and sent to reconditioning.</i>

194
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:50,136
No prior signs of nonconformity?

195
00:23:50,216 --> 00:23:52,136
<i>This was his first offense.</i>

196
00:23:52,216 --> 00:23:53,346
General!

197
00:23:53,426 --> 00:23:54,806
- They've been hit.
- Destroyed?

198
00:23:54,886 --> 00:23:56,146
Disabled.

199
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,646
They were headed back to Jakku.

200
00:23:57,726 --> 00:23:59,936
The fighter is projected to
crash in the Goazon badlands.

201
00:24:00,016 --> 00:24:01,686
They were going back for the droid.

202
00:24:01,816 --> 00:24:03,736
Send a squad to the wreckage.

203
00:24:26,086 --> 00:24:27,256
Poe!

204
00:24:28,586 --> 00:24:29,886
Poe!

205
00:24:30,716 --> 00:24:31,756
Poe!

206
00:24:35,226 --> 00:24:36,726
Poe! I got you.

207
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:39,896
Poe!

208
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:47,776
Poe!

209
00:26:11,986 --> 00:26:14,196
<i>Supreme Leader Snoke
was explicit.</i>

210
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:16,786
Capture the droid if we can,
but destroy it if we must.

211
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,656
<i>How capable
are your soldiers, General?</i>

212
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:20,246
I won't have you question my methods.

213
00:26:20,326 --> 00:26:22,366
<i>They're obviously skilled
at committing high treason.</i>

214
00:26:22,496 --> 00:26:25,286
<i>Perhaps Leader Snoke should
consider using a clone army.</i>

215
00:26:25,416 --> 00:26:26,456
My men are exceptionally trained.

216
00:26:26,546 --> 00:26:27,746
Programmed from birth.

217
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,126
<i>Then they should have
no problem retrieving the droid.</i>

218
00:26:30,216 --> 00:26:31,216
<i>Unharmed.</i>

219
00:26:32,296 --> 00:26:34,466
Careful, Ren, that your
personal interests...

220
00:26:34,546 --> 00:26:37,006
not interfere with orders
from Leader Snoke.

221
00:26:37,176 --> 00:26:39,596
<i>I want that map.</i>

222
00:26:39,676 --> 00:26:41,056
<i>For your sake...</i>

223
00:26:41,176 --> 00:26:42,386
<i>I suggest you get it.</i>

224
00:26:48,976 --> 00:26:50,146
Water. Water.

225
00:26:50,236 --> 00:26:51,276
No water.

226
00:26:51,356 --> 00:26:52,856
Water.

227
00:26:54,736 --> 00:26:55,816
Is there water?

228
00:27:24,266 --> 00:27:26,606
What? Oi, get off him!

229
00:27:36,066 --> 00:27:37,066
Hey!

230
00:27:53,466 --> 00:27:55,506
They work for Unkar.

231
00:27:55,626 --> 00:27:57,386
That guy that wanted you.

232
00:27:57,466 --> 00:27:59,096
He must have really wanted you.

233
00:28:01,466 --> 00:28:03,346
Who?

234
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,436
Him?

235
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:28,416
- What's your hurry, thief?
- What? Thief?

236
00:28:28,576 --> 00:28:30,036
Ow!

237
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:31,416
- Hey, what?
- The jacket.

238
00:28:31,496 --> 00:28:32,996
This droid says you stole it.

239
00:28:33,956 --> 00:28:35,626
I've had a pretty messed up
day, all right?

240
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:36,836
So I'd appreciate it...

241
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:38,176
if you stop accusing me of...

242
00:28:38,296 --> 00:28:40,716
- Ow! Stop it!
- Where'd you get it?

243
00:28:40,796 --> 00:28:42,136
It belongs to his master.

244
00:28:45,426 --> 00:28:48,516
It belonged to Poe Dameron.
That was his name, right?

245
00:28:50,556 --> 00:28:53,186
He was captured by the First Order.

246
00:28:53,316 --> 00:28:55,896
I helped him escape,
but our ship crashed.

247
00:28:59,026 --> 00:29:00,156
Poe didn't make it.

248
00:29:04,996 --> 00:29:07,156
I tried to help him. I'm sorry.

249
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:17,046
So you're with the Resistance?

250
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,006
Obviously.

251
00:29:23,176 --> 00:29:24,466
Yes, I am.

252
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:25,846
I'm with the Resistance, yeah.

253
00:29:25,966 --> 00:29:28,016
I am with the Resistance.

254
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:31,646
I've never met
a Resistance fighter before.

255
00:29:33,186 --> 00:29:34,646
Well, this is what we look like.

256
00:29:34,726 --> 00:29:37,276
Some of us. Others look different.

257
00:29:37,356 --> 00:29:38,816
BB-8 says he's on a secret mission.

258
00:29:38,896 --> 00:29:40,406
He has to get back to your base.

259
00:29:40,526 --> 00:29:42,776
Apparently, he has a map that
leads to Luke Skywalker...

260
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:44,526
and everyone's after it.

261
00:29:45,156 --> 00:29:46,866
Luke Skywalker?

262
00:29:47,406 --> 00:29:48,906
I thought he was a myth.

263
00:29:49,116 --> 00:29:51,206
What?

264
00:29:59,216 --> 00:30:00,756
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

265
00:30:02,046 --> 00:30:03,216
Come on, BB-8!

266
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:08,056
- Let go of me!
- Come on, we gotta move!

267
00:30:08,176 --> 00:30:10,266
I know how to run
without you holding my hand!

268
00:30:12,846 --> 00:30:14,646
BB-8, stay close!

269
00:30:14,726 --> 00:30:15,726
This way.

270
00:30:21,526 --> 00:30:22,736
<i>Call in the air strike.</i>

271
00:30:23,566 --> 00:30:25,116
Come on!

272
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:27,786
They're shooting at both of us.

273
00:30:27,906 --> 00:30:29,786
Yeah. They saw you with me.
You're marked.

274
00:30:29,906 --> 00:30:31,326
- Well, thanks for that.
- Hey!

275
00:30:31,406 --> 00:30:33,246
I'm not the one who chased
you down with a stick.

276
00:30:34,536 --> 00:30:36,036
Does anyone have
blasters around here?

277
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:37,666
Are you okay?

278
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,636
Stop taking my hand!

279
00:31:00,936 --> 00:31:01,946
Hey.

280
00:31:05,236 --> 00:31:06,276
Are you okay?

281
00:31:08,286 --> 00:31:09,286
Yeah.

282
00:31:09,946 --> 00:31:11,076
Follow me.

283
00:31:22,626 --> 00:31:23,876
- We can't outrun them!
- We might...

284
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:25,256
in that quadjumper!

285
00:31:25,336 --> 00:31:26,676
Hey, we need a pilot!

286
00:31:26,796 --> 00:31:28,346
We've got one.

287
00:31:28,466 --> 00:31:29,466
You?

288
00:31:30,136 --> 00:31:32,096
Uh, what about that ship?

289
00:31:32,176 --> 00:31:33,636
That one's garbage!

290
00:31:39,146 --> 00:31:40,606
The garbage will do.

291
00:31:56,496 --> 00:31:58,206
Gunner position is down there!

292
00:32:01,456 --> 00:32:03,086
You ever fly this thing?

293
00:32:03,206 --> 00:32:06,336
No! This ship hasn't flown in years.

294
00:32:06,506 --> 00:32:07,506
Great.

295
00:32:11,716 --> 00:32:12,926
Whoa.

296
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,136
I can do this. I can do this.

297
00:32:15,556 --> 00:32:17,186
I can do this. I can do this.

298
00:32:38,376 --> 00:32:39,376
Hey!

299
00:32:43,706 --> 00:32:45,256
That's mine!

300
00:32:48,836 --> 00:32:50,426
Wait, stay low! Hey, stay low!

301
00:32:50,546 --> 00:32:51,636
- What?
<i>- Stay low!</i>

302
00:32:51,716 --> 00:32:52,926
It confuses their tracking.

303
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:55,226
BB-8, hold on!

304
00:32:55,386 --> 00:32:56,766
I'm going low!

305
00:33:15,406 --> 00:33:16,616
What are you doing back there?

306
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:17,906
Are you ever gonna fire back?

307
00:33:18,076 --> 00:33:20,126
I'm working on it! Are the shields up?

308
00:33:20,246 --> 00:33:21,916
Not so easy without a co-pilot!

309
00:33:22,086 --> 00:33:23,956
Try sitting in this thing.

310
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,596
We need cover, quick!

311
00:33:39,766 --> 00:33:41,056
We're about to get some!

312
00:33:41,146 --> 00:33:42,356
I hope.

313
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,546
Damn it!

314
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:22,306
Come on, come on!

315
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,396
- Nice shot!
- I'm getting pretty good at this.

316
00:34:41,406 --> 00:34:43,036
Uh, the cannon's stuck
in forward position.

317
00:34:43,116 --> 00:34:44,786
I can't move it. You gotta lose him!

318
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:51,166
- Get ready!
- Okay. For what?

319
00:35:04,976 --> 00:35:06,106
Are we really doing this?

320
00:35:15,526 --> 00:35:16,866
Oh, no.

321
00:35:38,296 --> 00:35:39,306
Whoo!

322
00:35:53,696 --> 00:35:55,196
- Nice shooting.
- Now that was some flying.

323
00:35:55,276 --> 00:35:56,276
- Thanks.
- How did you do that?

324
00:35:56,356 --> 00:35:57,656
- I don't know.
- No one trained you?

325
00:35:57,736 --> 00:35:59,486
I've flown some ships, but
I've never left the planet.

326
00:35:59,576 --> 00:36:00,736
- Your last shot was dead-on.
- That was amazing.

327
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:02,156
- You got him with one blast!
- You set me up for it.

328
00:36:02,246 --> 00:36:03,616
- It was perfect.
- That was pretty good.

329
00:36:07,246 --> 00:36:09,246
You're okay. He's with the Resistance.

330
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,256
He's gonna get you home.

331
00:36:13,376 --> 00:36:14,376
We both will.

332
00:36:20,216 --> 00:36:21,346
I don't know your name.

333
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,846
Finn. What's yours?

334
00:36:26,136 --> 00:36:27,436
I'm Rey.

335
00:36:31,976 --> 00:36:33,316
Rey...

336
00:36:33,936 --> 00:36:36,236
Help me with this. Quick!

337
00:36:36,316 --> 00:36:37,696
Whoa, what's going on?

338
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,126
Sir...

339
00:36:50,206 --> 00:36:52,836
we were unable to acquire
the droid on Jakku.

340
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,466
It escaped capture...

341
00:36:56,546 --> 00:36:59,136
aboard a stolen
Corellian YT model freighter.

342
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,756
<i>The droid...</i>

343
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:04,466
<i>stole a freighter?</i>

344
00:37:04,596 --> 00:37:05,976
Not exactly, sir.

345
00:37:06,636 --> 00:37:07,636
It had help.

346
00:37:11,266 --> 00:37:12,356
We have no confirmation...

347
00:37:12,476 --> 00:37:14,856
but we believe FN-2187 may
have helped in the escape.

348
00:37:33,206 --> 00:37:34,206
<i>Anything else?</i>

349
00:37:37,086 --> 00:37:38,506
The two were accompanied by a girl.

350
00:37:43,926 --> 00:37:45,676
<i>What girl?</i>

351
00:37:48,386 --> 00:37:49,476
It's the motivator.

352
00:37:49,556 --> 00:37:51,056
Grab me a Harris wrench,
check in there.

353
00:37:51,146 --> 00:37:52,146
How bad is it?

354
00:37:52,226 --> 00:37:53,896
If we wanna live, not good.

355
00:37:54,016 --> 00:37:54,976
They're hunting for us now.

356
00:37:55,066 --> 00:37:56,226
We've gotta get out of this system!

357
00:37:56,356 --> 00:37:57,856
BB-8 said the location
of the Resistance base...

358
00:37:58,026 --> 00:37:59,066
is "need to know".

359
00:37:59,196 --> 00:38:00,816
If I'm taking you there, I need to know!

360
00:38:00,906 --> 00:38:01,906
This?

361
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:04,776
You gotta tell us
where your base is.

362
00:38:04,906 --> 00:38:07,496
I don't speak that.

363
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:09,326
All right, between us...

364
00:38:09,406 --> 00:38:10,866
I'm not with the Resistance, okay?

365
00:38:11,866 --> 00:38:13,456
I'm just trying to get away
from the First Order.

366
00:38:13,536 --> 00:38:15,286
But you tell us where the base is...

367
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,796
I'll get you there first. Deal?

368
00:38:17,876 --> 00:38:20,376
- Droid, please!
- Pilex driver, hurry.

369
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:23,136
- So, where's your base?
- Go on, BB-8, tell her.

370
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:27,346
Please.

371
00:38:29,386 --> 00:38:31,266
- The Ileenium system?
- Yeah, the Ileenium system.

372
00:38:31,386 --> 00:38:33,016
That's the one. Get us there
as fast as you can.

373
00:38:33,396 --> 00:38:34,726
I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal.

374
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:35,976
I need the bonding tape, hurry!

375
00:38:36,066 --> 00:38:37,146
What about you?

376
00:38:37,226 --> 00:38:38,436
I gotta get back to Jakku.

377
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,526
Back to Jak...

378
00:38:39,606 --> 00:38:41,066
Why does everyone
wanna go back to Jakku?

379
00:38:41,146 --> 00:38:43,736
- It's not that one. No. No.
- That place is...

380
00:38:43,866 --> 00:38:45,736
The one I'm pointing to. No.

381
00:38:45,826 --> 00:38:47,116
No. No!

382
00:38:47,236 --> 00:38:48,576
If we don't patch it up...

383
00:38:48,746 --> 00:38:49,786
the propulsion tank will overflow...

384
00:38:49,866 --> 00:38:51,536
and flood the ship with poisonous gas!

385
00:38:51,616 --> 00:38:52,616
- This?
- Yes.

386
00:38:53,996 --> 00:38:56,836
Hey, Rey, you're a pilot.

387
00:38:56,916 --> 00:38:58,836
You can fly anywhere. Why go back?

388
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:00,206
You got a family?

389
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,416
You got a boyfriend? A cute boyfriend?

390
00:39:01,546 --> 00:39:03,006
None of your business, that's why.

391
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:06,796
- That can't be good.
- No, it can't be.

392
00:39:12,766 --> 00:39:13,766
Someone's locked on to us.

393
00:39:13,896 --> 00:39:15,436
All controls are overridden.

394
00:39:22,236 --> 00:39:23,946
Get off! Get off!

395
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,696
See anything?

396
00:39:28,156 --> 00:39:29,156
Oh, no.

397
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,416
It's the First Order.

398
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,296
What do we do?
There must be something.

399
00:39:41,086 --> 00:39:42,756
- You said poisonous gas.
- I fixed that.

400
00:39:42,836 --> 00:39:43,836
Can you unfix it?

401
00:39:49,636 --> 00:39:50,636
Come on, BB-8.

402
00:39:51,386 --> 00:39:53,266
I got him.

403
00:39:54,596 --> 00:39:56,346
I'm okay.

404
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,726
BB-8, get off me!

405
00:40:01,606 --> 00:40:03,276
Do you think this will work
on the stormtroopers?

406
00:40:03,356 --> 00:40:05,906
Yeah. Their masks filter out
smoke, not toxins.

407
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:14,456
- Hurry.
- I'm hurrying.

408
00:40:26,546 --> 00:40:28,966
Chewie...

409
00:40:29,046 --> 00:40:30,296
we're home.

410
00:40:46,316 --> 00:40:47,486
Where are the others?

411
00:40:47,566 --> 00:40:49,156
- Where's the pilot?
<i>- I'm the pilot.</i>

412
00:40:49,236 --> 00:40:50,696
You?

413
00:40:50,776 --> 00:40:52,736
<i>No, it's true.
We're the only ones on board.</i>

414
00:40:52,826 --> 00:40:54,246
<i>You can understand that thing?</i>

415
00:40:54,366 --> 00:40:55,496
And "that thing"
can understand you, too...

416
00:40:55,576 --> 00:40:56,616
so watch it.

417
00:40:56,706 --> 00:40:58,616
Come on out of there.

418
00:40:59,326 --> 00:41:01,206
- Where'd you get this ship?
- Niima Outpost.

419
00:41:01,336 --> 00:41:03,876
Jakku? That junkyard?

420
00:41:03,956 --> 00:41:05,166
Thank you! Junkyard.

421
00:41:05,256 --> 00:41:07,336
Told you we should have
double-checked the Western Reaches.

422
00:41:07,426 --> 00:41:09,176
Who had it? Ducain?

423
00:41:09,256 --> 00:41:11,096
I stole it. From Unkar Plutt.

424
00:41:11,176 --> 00:41:13,386
He stole it from the Irving Boys,
who stole it from Ducain.

425
00:41:13,506 --> 00:41:15,806
Who stole it from me!

426
00:41:15,886 --> 00:41:17,306
Well, you tell him that Han Solo...

427
00:41:17,386 --> 00:41:19,766
just stole back the
<i>Millennium Falcon</i> for good.

428
00:41:19,896 --> 00:41:22,766
This is the <i>Millennium Falcon?</i>
You're Han Solo?

429
00:41:24,396 --> 00:41:25,936
I used to be.

430
00:41:26,606 --> 00:41:28,066
Han Solo, the Rebellion general?

431
00:41:28,146 --> 00:41:29,526
No, the smuggler.

432
00:41:29,606 --> 00:41:31,446
Wasn't he a war hero?

433
00:41:31,526 --> 00:41:34,866
This is the ship that made
the Kessel Run in 14 parsecs?

434
00:41:34,946 --> 00:41:36,196
Twelve!

435
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,746
Fourteen.

436
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:55,256
Hey!

437
00:41:55,766 --> 00:41:58,766
Some moof-milker
put a compressor on the ignition line.

438
00:41:58,846 --> 00:41:59,936
Unkar Plutt did.

439
00:42:00,016 --> 00:42:01,396
I thought it was a mistake,
too. Puts too much...

440
00:42:01,476 --> 00:42:03,766
...stress on the hyperdrive.

441
00:42:04,816 --> 00:42:06,276
Chewie, throw them in a pod.

442
00:42:06,396 --> 00:42:08,276
We'll drop them at the
nearest inhabited planet.

443
00:42:08,356 --> 00:42:10,066
Wait, no.

444
00:42:10,146 --> 00:42:12,566
- We need your help.
- My help?

445
00:42:12,656 --> 00:42:14,196
This droid has to get
to the Resistance base...

446
00:42:14,276 --> 00:42:15,576
as soon as possible.

447
00:42:16,286 --> 00:42:18,656
He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker.

448
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:26,086
You are the Han Solo that
fought with the Rebellion.

449
00:42:32,176 --> 00:42:33,176
You knew him.

450
00:42:36,506 --> 00:42:39,636
Yeah. I knew him.

451
00:42:39,726 --> 00:42:41,346
I knew Luke.

452
00:42:44,146 --> 00:42:46,436
Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten loose.

453
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,106
Wait, what?

454
00:42:49,026 --> 00:42:50,696
Did you just say Rathtars?

455
00:42:51,446 --> 00:42:52,446
Hey!

456
00:42:52,526 --> 00:42:55,066
You're not hauling Rathtars
on this freighter, are you?

457
00:42:55,616 --> 00:42:57,826
I'm hauling Rathtars.

458
00:42:57,906 --> 00:43:01,116
Oh, great. It's the Guavian Death Gang.

459
00:43:01,206 --> 00:43:02,666
Must have tracked us from Nantoon.

460
00:43:02,786 --> 00:43:04,576
What's a Rathtar?

461
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:06,166
They're big and they're dangerous.

462
00:43:06,246 --> 00:43:07,796
You ever heard of the Trillia Massacre?

463
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:08,916
- No.
- Good.

464
00:43:09,006 --> 00:43:10,876
I got three of them going to King Prana.

465
00:43:10,966 --> 00:43:13,296
Three? How'd you get them on board?

466
00:43:13,376 --> 00:43:15,086
I used to have a bigger crew.

467
00:43:18,676 --> 00:43:20,596
Get below and stay there
until I say so...

468
00:43:20,676 --> 00:43:22,266
and don't even think about
taking the <i>Falcon.</i>

469
00:43:22,346 --> 00:43:23,346
What about BB-8?

470
00:43:23,436 --> 00:43:25,146
He stays with me
until I get rid of the gang...

471
00:43:25,226 --> 00:43:26,766
then you can have him back
and be on your way.

472
00:43:26,856 --> 00:43:28,816
What about the Rathtars?
Where are you keeping them?

473
00:43:31,236 --> 00:43:33,276
- There's one.
- What are you gonna do?

474
00:43:33,356 --> 00:43:35,656
Same thing I always do.
Talk my way out of it.

475
00:43:36,986 --> 00:43:39,236
Yes, I do. Every time.

476
00:43:56,506 --> 00:43:58,506
Han Solo.

477
00:43:58,596 --> 00:44:00,056
You're a dead man.

478
00:44:00,176 --> 00:44:02,886
Bala-Tik. What's the problem?

479
00:44:03,096 --> 00:44:05,766
The problem is we loaned you
50,000 for this job.

480
00:44:05,936 --> 00:44:08,396
- Can you see them?
- No.

481
00:44:08,556 --> 00:44:11,566
I heard you also borrowed
50,000 from Kanjiklub.

482
00:44:11,776 --> 00:44:13,896
You know you can't trust
those little freaks.

483
00:44:14,566 --> 00:44:16,986
How long we known each other?

484
00:44:17,066 --> 00:44:18,156
They have blasters.

485
00:44:18,236 --> 00:44:19,326
A lot of them.

486
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:22,616
Not long.
We want our money back now.

487
00:44:22,696 --> 00:44:24,706
You think hunting
Rathtars is cheap?

488
00:44:24,786 --> 00:44:25,956
I spent that money.

489
00:44:26,036 --> 00:44:28,456
Kanjiklub wants
their investment back, too.

490
00:44:28,576 --> 00:44:30,876
I never made a deal with Kanjiklub!

491
00:44:30,956 --> 00:44:32,836
Tell that to Kanjiklub.

492
00:44:42,136 --> 00:44:44,346
Tasu Leech.

493
00:44:44,426 --> 00:44:45,426
Good to see you.

494
00:44:54,276 --> 00:44:57,276
Boys, you're both gonna
get what I promised.

495
00:44:57,356 --> 00:44:58,736
Have I ever not delivered...

496
00:44:58,816 --> 00:45:00,316
- for you before?
- Yeah.

497
00:45:04,616 --> 00:45:07,616
- What was the second time?
- Your game is old.

498
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:10,246
There's no one in the galaxy
left for you to swindle.

499
00:45:12,916 --> 00:45:13,916
That BB unit.

500
00:45:13,996 --> 00:45:16,836
The First Order is looking
for one just like it.

501
00:45:20,336 --> 00:45:21,636
And two fugitives.

502
00:45:25,516 --> 00:45:26,636
First I've heard of it.

503
00:45:32,476 --> 00:45:33,646
Wait, wait, wait.

504
00:45:36,816 --> 00:45:38,856
If we close the blast doors
in that corridor...

505
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,106
we can trap both gangs!

506
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:41,656
We'll close the blast doors from here?

507
00:45:41,736 --> 00:45:43,526
Resetting the fuses should do it.

508
00:45:51,496 --> 00:45:53,286
I got a bad feeling about this.

509
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:55,496
- Oh, no.
- "Oh, no," what?

510
00:45:56,456 --> 00:45:57,466
Wrong fuses.

511
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:58,716
Kill them!

512
00:45:58,836 --> 00:46:00,046
- Whoa...
- And take the droid!

513
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,696
- This was a mistake!
- Huge!

514
00:46:40,926 --> 00:46:41,926
What do they look like?

515
00:46:47,886 --> 00:46:49,886
They look like that.

516
00:46:52,136 --> 00:46:53,976
- This way.
- Are you sure?

517
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,066
No, no, no!

518
00:46:58,106 --> 00:46:59,486
Finn!

519
00:47:00,486 --> 00:47:01,566
Finn!

520
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:03,736
Rey!

521
00:47:06,906 --> 00:47:08,196
Get off! Get off!

522
00:47:13,616 --> 00:47:15,956
- Rey!
- Finn!

523
00:47:17,166 --> 00:47:18,246
Finn!

524
00:47:18,916 --> 00:47:20,586
<i>Get off me!</i>

525
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:33,766
<i>Rey!</i>

526
00:47:36,806 --> 00:47:39,686
Get off! Get off!

527
00:47:42,106 --> 00:47:43,606
Finn!

528
00:47:44,276 --> 00:47:46,616
- It had me! But the door...
- That was lucky.

529
00:47:50,656 --> 00:47:52,956
I got the door. Cover us!

530
00:47:59,796 --> 00:48:01,666
Chewie!

531
00:48:04,546 --> 00:48:06,136
You okay?

532
00:48:07,296 --> 00:48:08,296
Wow.

533
00:48:10,506 --> 00:48:12,726
Come on! Come on!

534
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:17,476
Han.

535
00:48:17,556 --> 00:48:19,816
You, close the door behind us.
You, take care of Chewie!

536
00:48:27,486 --> 00:48:28,736
Hey, where are you going?

537
00:48:28,816 --> 00:48:30,486
Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump, too.

538
00:48:30,576 --> 00:48:32,366
If we don't prime that,
we're not going anywhere.

539
00:48:32,486 --> 00:48:33,656
I hate that guy.

540
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:36,286
- And you could use a co-pilot.
- I got one, he's back there.

541
00:48:38,746 --> 00:48:40,706
Watch the thrust. We're going
out of here at lightspeed.

542
00:48:40,836 --> 00:48:42,626
From inside the hangar?
Is that even possible?

543
00:48:42,706 --> 00:48:44,966
I never ask that question
till after I've done it.

544
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:49,346
This is not how I thought
this day was gonna go.

545
00:48:49,466 --> 00:48:51,426
Angle the shield. Hang on back there.

546
00:48:51,506 --> 00:48:52,676
No problem!

547
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:03,856
Come on, baby, don't let me down.

548
00:49:06,396 --> 00:49:08,356
- What?
- Compressor.

549
00:49:16,866 --> 00:49:18,076
Inform the First Order...

550
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:19,996
that Han Solo has the droid they want.

551
00:49:20,076 --> 00:49:22,086
And it's aboard the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>

552
00:49:31,006 --> 00:49:35,386
<i>The droid will soon be
delivered to the Resistance...</i>

553
00:49:36,596 --> 00:49:40,396
leading them to the last Jedi.

554
00:49:41,606 --> 00:49:45,356
If Skywalker returns...

555
00:49:45,896 --> 00:49:49,906
the new Jedi will rise.

556
00:49:51,066 --> 00:49:52,616
Supreme Leader,
I take full responsibility...

557
00:49:52,736 --> 00:49:54,406
General!

558
00:49:56,616 --> 00:49:59,416
Our strategy must now change.

559
00:49:59,536 --> 00:50:01,576
The weapon. It is ready.

560
00:50:01,706 --> 00:50:03,956
I believe the time has come to use it.

561
00:50:04,086 --> 00:50:05,376
We shall destroy the government...

562
00:50:05,456 --> 00:50:06,876
that supports the Resistance...

563
00:50:06,956 --> 00:50:08,666
the Republic.

564
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:10,296
Without their friends to protect them...

565
00:50:10,376 --> 00:50:11,966
the Resistance will be vulnerable.

566
00:50:12,216 --> 00:50:15,136
And we will stop them
before they reach Skywalker.

567
00:50:15,216 --> 00:50:16,466
Go.

568
00:50:17,266 --> 00:50:18,676
Oversee preparations.

569
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:20,436
Yes, Supreme Leader.

570
00:50:26,396 --> 00:50:27,776
There has been an awakening.

571
00:50:29,486 --> 00:50:31,236
Have you felt it?

572
00:50:32,776 --> 00:50:33,816
<i>Yes.</i>

573
00:50:35,196 --> 00:50:36,826
There's something more.

574
00:50:38,366 --> 00:50:42,536
The droid we seek is aboard
the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>

575
00:50:43,326 --> 00:50:46,206
In the hands of your father...

576
00:50:46,296 --> 00:50:50,126
Han Solo.

577
00:50:52,756 --> 00:50:55,136
<i>He means nothing to me.</i>

578
00:50:55,256 --> 00:51:00,056
Even you, master of the
Knights of Ren...

579
00:51:00,676 --> 00:51:04,146
have never faced such a test.

580
00:51:04,766 --> 00:51:07,976
<i>By the grace of your training,
I will not be seduced.</i>

581
00:51:09,106 --> 00:51:10,936
We shall see.

582
00:51:13,526 --> 00:51:15,366
We shall see.

583
00:51:23,456 --> 00:51:25,666
- Electrical overload.
- I can fix that.

584
00:51:25,786 --> 00:51:27,036
Coolant's leaking.

585
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:29,626
Try transferring auxiliary power...

586
00:51:29,756 --> 00:51:31,126
...to the secondary tank.

587
00:51:31,216 --> 00:51:32,756
I got it.

588
00:51:32,926 --> 00:51:34,546
Chewie, come on!

589
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,756
I need help with this giant hairy thing!

590
00:51:37,846 --> 00:51:38,846
Stop moving!

591
00:51:40,886 --> 00:51:42,676
Chewie!

592
00:51:42,806 --> 00:51:44,516
You hurt Chewie,
you're gonna deal with me!

593
00:51:44,646 --> 00:51:46,976
Hurt him? He almost killed me six times!

594
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,356
Which is fine!

595
00:51:49,476 --> 00:51:50,936
This hyperdrive blows,
there are gonna be...

596
00:51:51,026 --> 00:51:52,986
pieces of us in three different systems.

597
00:51:56,366 --> 00:51:57,366
What'd you do?

598
00:51:58,406 --> 00:52:00,326
I bypassed the compressor.

599
00:52:02,656 --> 00:52:03,656
Huh.

600
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:08,206
Move, ball.

601
00:52:10,376 --> 00:52:12,456
Ah, don't say that.

602
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:14,216
You did great. Just rest.

603
00:52:15,126 --> 00:52:16,216
Good job, kid.

604
00:52:16,676 --> 00:52:17,676
Thanks.

605
00:52:18,216 --> 00:52:19,506
You're welcome.

606
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:25,686
So...

607
00:52:25,806 --> 00:52:27,146
fugitives, huh?

608
00:52:29,056 --> 00:52:30,356
The First Order wants the map.

609
00:52:30,436 --> 00:52:31,726
Finn is with the Resistance.

610
00:52:32,356 --> 00:52:33,776
I'm just a scavenger.

611
00:52:35,816 --> 00:52:36,816
Let's see what you got.

612
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,776
Go ahead.

613
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:51,086
This map's not complete.

614
00:52:51,166 --> 00:52:52,666
It's just a piece.

615
00:52:53,876 --> 00:52:55,666
Ever since Luke disappeared...

616
00:52:55,796 --> 00:52:57,796
people have been looking for him.

617
00:52:57,886 --> 00:52:59,386
Why did he leave?

618
00:53:00,596 --> 00:53:03,346
He was training
a new generation of Jedi.

619
00:53:03,426 --> 00:53:05,096
One boy, an apprentice...

620
00:53:05,176 --> 00:53:07,476
turned against him, destroyed it all.

621
00:53:09,056 --> 00:53:10,976
Luke felt responsible.

622
00:53:11,056 --> 00:53:13,566
He just walked away from everything.

623
00:53:14,276 --> 00:53:15,736
Do you know what happened to him?

624
00:53:15,896 --> 00:53:18,276
A lot of rumors. Stories.

625
00:53:20,276 --> 00:53:22,486
People that knew him best...

626
00:53:23,986 --> 00:53:26,366
think he went looking
for the first Jedi temple.

627
00:53:28,116 --> 00:53:29,456
The Jedi were real?

628
00:53:29,536 --> 00:53:31,746
I used to wonder about that myself.

629
00:53:31,836 --> 00:53:34,046
Thought it was a bunch
of mumbo-jumbo.

630
00:53:34,916 --> 00:53:37,506
A magical power holding
together good and evil...

631
00:53:37,586 --> 00:53:39,716
the dark side and the light.

632
00:53:41,086 --> 00:53:43,256
Crazy thing is...

633
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,096
it's true.

634
00:53:49,646 --> 00:53:51,266
The Force. The Jedi.

635
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:54,856
All of it.

636
00:53:58,106 --> 00:53:59,446
It's all true.

637
00:54:02,696 --> 00:54:04,826
No, you rest.

638
00:54:04,946 --> 00:54:07,696
You want my help? You're getting it.

639
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:09,826
Gonna see an old friend.
She'll get your droid home.

640
00:54:11,116 --> 00:54:12,456
This is our stop.

641
00:54:29,846 --> 00:54:31,346
I didn't know there was
this much green...

642
00:54:31,436 --> 00:54:32,726
in the whole galaxy.

643
00:55:00,716 --> 00:55:02,756
Hey, Solo, I'm not sure what
we're walking into here...

644
00:55:02,876 --> 00:55:04,506
Did you just call me Solo?

645
00:55:04,586 --> 00:55:06,216
Sorry. Han. Mr. Solo.

646
00:55:06,296 --> 00:55:07,386
You should know...

647
00:55:07,466 --> 00:55:09,846
I'm a big deal in the Resistance.

648
00:55:09,926 --> 00:55:12,266
Which puts a real target on my back.

649
00:55:12,386 --> 00:55:13,976
Are there any conspirators here?

650
00:55:14,056 --> 00:55:15,936
Like, First Order sympathizers?

651
00:55:16,056 --> 00:55:18,726
Listen, Big Deal.

652
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:20,736
You got another problem.

653
00:55:20,816 --> 00:55:22,986
Women always figure out the truth.

654
00:55:24,566 --> 00:55:25,906
Always.

655
00:55:31,906 --> 00:55:33,286
You might need this.

656
00:55:34,576 --> 00:55:36,246
I think I can handle myself.

657
00:55:36,376 --> 00:55:38,496
I know you do. That's why
I'm giving it to you.

658
00:55:38,586 --> 00:55:39,586
Take it.

659
00:55:42,416 --> 00:55:43,586
You know how to use one of those?

660
00:55:43,676 --> 00:55:45,336
Yeah. You pull the trigger.

661
00:55:45,426 --> 00:55:47,256
Little bit more to it than that.

662
00:55:47,756 --> 00:55:49,426
You got a lot to learn.

663
00:55:50,846 --> 00:55:52,096
You got a name?

664
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,016
Rey.

665
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:55,726
Rey.

666
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:02,026
I been thinking about bringing
on some more crew, Rey.

667
00:56:02,106 --> 00:56:04,066
A second mate. Someone to help out.

668
00:56:04,146 --> 00:56:05,776
Someone who can keep up
with Chewie and me...

669
00:56:05,856 --> 00:56:07,446
appreciates the <i>Falcon.</i>

670
00:56:07,566 --> 00:56:09,366
Are you offering me a job?

671
00:56:09,446 --> 00:56:11,946
I wouldn't be nice to you.
Doesn't pay much.

672
00:56:12,076 --> 00:56:13,906
You're offering me a job.

673
00:56:15,116 --> 00:56:16,626
I'm thinking about it.

674
00:56:20,296 --> 00:56:21,456
Well?

675
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:28,636
If you were, I'd be flattered.
But I have to get home.

676
00:56:29,546 --> 00:56:31,056
Where, Jakku?

677
00:56:31,636 --> 00:56:33,426
I've already been away too long.

678
00:56:35,136 --> 00:56:37,516
Chewie, check out the ship
as best you can.

679
00:56:41,226 --> 00:56:44,146
That's too bad. Chewie kind of likes you.

680
00:56:47,236 --> 00:56:48,906
Solo, why are we here again?

681
00:56:49,026 --> 00:56:50,526
To get your droid on a clean ship.

682
00:56:50,656 --> 00:56:51,616
Clean?

683
00:56:51,696 --> 00:56:54,576
You think it was luck
that Chewie and I found the <i>Falcon?</i>

684
00:56:55,246 --> 00:56:56,786
If we can find it on our scanners...

685
00:56:56,866 --> 00:56:59,206
the First Order's not far behind.

686
00:56:59,326 --> 00:57:02,126
Wanna get BB-8 to the Resistance?

687
00:57:02,206 --> 00:57:04,046
Maz Kanata's our best bet.

688
00:57:04,916 --> 00:57:06,416
We can trust her, right?

689
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,046
Relax, kid.

690
00:57:08,176 --> 00:57:10,846
She's run this watering hole
for a thousand years.

691
00:57:11,596 --> 00:57:13,636
Maz is a bit of an acquired taste...

692
00:57:13,716 --> 00:57:15,096
so let me do the talking.

693
00:57:15,176 --> 00:57:16,936
And whatever you do, don't stare.

694
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:18,056
At what?

695
00:57:19,096 --> 00:57:20,186
Any of it.

696
00:57:41,376 --> 00:57:43,376
Han Solo!

697
00:57:47,546 --> 00:57:48,796
Oh, boy.

698
00:57:48,926 --> 00:57:50,086
Hey, Maz.

699
00:57:53,926 --> 00:57:55,886
Where's my boyfriend?

700
00:57:56,386 --> 00:57:58,016
Chewie's working on the <i>Falcon.</i>

701
00:57:58,096 --> 00:57:59,096
I like that Wookiee.

702
00:57:59,896 --> 00:58:01,856
I assume you need something.

703
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:03,356
Desperately.

704
00:58:03,436 --> 00:58:04,436
Let's get to it.

705
00:58:58,996 --> 00:59:00,456
<i>Forgive me.</i>

706
00:59:03,116 --> 00:59:04,786
<i>I feel it again.</i>

707
00:59:08,456 --> 00:59:10,006
<i>The pull to the light.</i>

708
00:59:12,836 --> 00:59:15,346
<i>Supreme Leader senses it.</i>

709
00:59:16,426 --> 00:59:17,806
<i>Show me again.</i>

710
00:59:18,306 --> 00:59:20,476
<i>The power of the darkness.</i>

711
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:24,346
<i>And I will let nothing stand in our way.</i>

712
00:59:25,306 --> 00:59:26,686
<i>Show me...</i>

713
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:30,186
<i>Grandfather...</i>

714
00:59:32,646 --> 00:59:34,986
<i>and I will finish...</i>

715
00:59:35,116 --> 00:59:36,486
<i>what you started.</i>

716
00:59:49,296 --> 00:59:50,706
A map.

717
00:59:51,336 --> 00:59:53,466
To Skywalker himself?

718
00:59:53,546 --> 00:59:56,296
You are right back
in the mess.

719
00:59:56,386 --> 00:59:59,846
Maz, I need you to get this droid to Leia.

720
01:00:00,676 --> 01:00:01,676
Hmm...

721
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:02,806
No.

722
01:00:04,186 --> 01:00:08,186
You've been running away
from this fight for too long.

723
01:00:08,686 --> 01:00:09,646
Han.

724
01:00:12,356 --> 01:00:13,856
Go home.

725
01:00:14,526 --> 01:00:15,816
Leia doesn't wanna see me.

726
01:00:15,906 --> 01:00:18,116
Please, we came here for your help.

727
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:20,366
What fight?

728
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:23,616
The only fight.

729
01:00:23,706 --> 01:00:25,866
Against the dark side.

730
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:27,286
Through the ages...

731
01:00:27,376 --> 01:00:29,496
I've seen evil take many forms.

732
01:00:30,586 --> 01:00:32,796
The Sith. The Empire.

733
01:00:32,876 --> 01:00:36,216
Today, it is the First Order.

734
01:00:37,006 --> 01:00:39,926
Their shadow is spreading
across the galaxy.

735
01:00:40,056 --> 01:00:41,426
We must face them.

736
01:00:41,556 --> 01:00:43,596
Fight them.

737
01:00:43,726 --> 01:00:45,266
All of us.

738
01:00:45,886 --> 01:00:47,476
There is no fight against the First Order.

739
01:00:47,556 --> 01:00:48,686
Not one we can win.

740
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:51,146
Look around.

741
01:00:51,226 --> 01:00:53,606
There's no chance we haven't
been recognized already.

742
01:00:53,736 --> 01:00:55,946
I bet you the First Order
is on their way right...

743
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:58,236
What's this?

744
01:01:00,076 --> 01:01:01,076
What are you doing?

745
01:01:05,786 --> 01:01:07,286
Solo, what is she doing?

746
01:01:07,416 --> 01:01:09,166
I don't know. But it ain't good.

747
01:01:09,326 --> 01:01:11,126
If you live long enough...

748
01:01:11,206 --> 01:01:14,706
you see the same eyes
in different people.

749
01:01:15,626 --> 01:01:20,096
I'm looking at the eyes
of a man who wants to run.

750
01:01:22,966 --> 01:01:24,926
You don't know a thing about me.

751
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:29,266
Where I'm from. What I've seen.

752
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,606
You don't know the First Order like I do.

753
01:01:33,566 --> 01:01:35,736
They'll slaughter us.

754
01:01:35,816 --> 01:01:37,946
We all need to run.

755
01:01:39,066 --> 01:01:40,116
Hmm.

756
01:01:46,406 --> 01:01:47,406
You see those two?

757
01:01:48,116 --> 01:01:49,746
They'll trade work for transportation...

758
01:01:49,866 --> 01:01:51,286
to the Outer Rim.

759
01:01:51,376 --> 01:01:53,586
There, you can disappear.

760
01:01:53,796 --> 01:01:54,796
Finn?

761
01:01:57,216 --> 01:01:58,216
Come with me.

762
01:01:59,256 --> 01:02:01,296
What about BB-8? We're not done yet.

763
01:02:01,386 --> 01:02:03,046
We have to get him back to your base.

764
01:02:08,136 --> 01:02:09,476
I can't.

765
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:19,486
Keep it, kid.

766
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:31,166
Who's the girl?

767
01:02:36,126 --> 01:02:38,086
I was told you can get me
to the Outer Rim.

768
01:02:38,166 --> 01:02:39,256
What are you doing?

769
01:02:41,006 --> 01:02:42,006
Don't leave without me.

770
01:02:45,846 --> 01:02:47,676
You can't just go. I won't let you.

771
01:02:47,766 --> 01:02:48,846
I'm not who you think I am.

772
01:02:48,926 --> 01:02:50,016
Finn, what are you talking about?

773
01:02:50,096 --> 01:02:51,136
I'm not Resistance.

774
01:02:51,846 --> 01:02:53,346
I'm not a hero.

775
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:58,356
I'm a stormtrooper.

776
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:02,446
Like all of them, I was taken
from a family I'll never know.

777
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:05,196
And raised to do one thing.

778
01:03:05,906 --> 01:03:09,036
But my first battle, I made a choice.

779
01:03:10,206 --> 01:03:12,036
I wasn't gonna kill for them.

780
01:03:12,706 --> 01:03:15,626
So I ran. Right into you.

781
01:03:17,206 --> 01:03:19,296
And you looked at me
like no one ever had.

782
01:03:22,216 --> 01:03:24,506
I was ashamed of what I was.

783
01:03:27,056 --> 01:03:29,056
But I'm done with the First Order.

784
01:03:29,176 --> 01:03:30,976
I'm never going back.

785
01:03:33,056 --> 01:03:34,806
Rey, come with me.

786
01:03:35,896 --> 01:03:37,146
Don't go.

787
01:03:42,316 --> 01:03:44,066
Take care of yourself.

788
01:03:45,866 --> 01:03:47,526
Please.

789
01:04:01,256 --> 01:04:03,336
<i>No!</i>

790
01:04:03,416 --> 01:04:05,586
<i>No!</i>

791
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:21,776
<i>No! Come back!</i>

792
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:24,566
<i>No!</i>

793
01:04:40,626 --> 01:04:42,456
<i>Come back!</i>

794
01:04:52,806 --> 01:04:54,636
<i>No!</i>

795
01:05:45,606 --> 01:05:47,446
<i>No!</i>

796
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:49,066
<i>Its energy...</i>

797
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:54,906
- ...<i>surrounds us...</i>
<i>- No!</i>

798
01:05:55,036 --> 01:05:57,366
...<i>and binds us...</i>

799
01:06:05,206 --> 01:06:06,336
<i>The Force will be...</i>

800
01:06:15,386 --> 01:06:16,886
<i>No!</i>

801
01:06:17,016 --> 01:06:18,886
Come back!

802
01:06:19,016 --> 01:06:20,516
<i>Quiet, girl.</i>

803
01:06:21,396 --> 01:06:22,396
No!

804
01:06:26,976 --> 01:06:27,986
<i>Rey?</i>

805
01:06:32,566 --> 01:06:35,276
<i>These are your first steps.</i>

806
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:41,246
What was that?

807
01:06:43,496 --> 01:06:45,206
I shouldn't have gone in there.

808
01:06:47,456 --> 01:06:49,916
That lightsaber was Luke's.

809
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:51,796
And his father's before him.

810
01:06:51,926 --> 01:06:55,556
And now, it calls to you.

811
01:06:55,676 --> 01:06:57,096
I have to get back to Jakku.

812
01:06:57,766 --> 01:06:59,426
Han told me.

813
01:07:07,186 --> 01:07:09,236
Dear child.

814
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:11,356
I see your eyes.

815
01:07:11,446 --> 01:07:14,446
You already know the truth.

816
01:07:14,526 --> 01:07:16,986
Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku...

817
01:07:18,286 --> 01:07:20,286
they're never coming back.

818
01:07:26,336 --> 01:07:27,456
But...

819
01:07:27,546 --> 01:07:29,956
there's someone who still could.

820
01:07:32,676 --> 01:07:34,256
Luke.

821
01:07:34,336 --> 01:07:38,006
The belonging you seek
is not behind you...

822
01:07:38,136 --> 01:07:39,806
it is ahead.

823
01:07:39,926 --> 01:07:43,476
I am no Jedi, but I know the Force.

824
01:07:43,596 --> 01:07:47,686
It moves through and surrounds
every living thing.

825
01:07:49,606 --> 01:07:51,186
Close your eyes.

826
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:54,486
Feel it.

827
01:07:55,776 --> 01:07:57,866
The light...

828
01:07:57,986 --> 01:08:00,366
it's always been there.

829
01:08:00,496 --> 01:08:02,496
It will guide you.

830
01:08:04,616 --> 01:08:06,666
The saber. Take it.

831
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:12,626
I'm never touching that thing again.

832
01:08:12,716 --> 01:08:14,216
I don't want any part of this.

833
01:08:17,676 --> 01:08:18,676
Hmm.

834
01:08:40,696 --> 01:08:44,206
<i>Today is the end
of the Republic.</i>

835
01:08:46,206 --> 01:08:51,706
<i>The end of a regime
that acquiesces to disorder.</i>

836
01:08:53,006 --> 01:08:57,086
<i>At this very moment,
in a system far from here...</i>

837
01:08:57,216 --> 01:09:02,056
<i>the New Republic lies to the galaxy...</i>

838
01:09:02,176 --> 01:09:05,766
<i>while secretly supporting
the treachery...</i>

839
01:09:06,556 --> 01:09:09,896
<i>of the loathsome Resistance.</i>

840
01:09:09,976 --> 01:09:13,476
<i>This fierce machine
which you have built...</i>

841
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:15,396
<i>upon which we stand...</i>

842
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:17,906
<i>will bring an end to the Senate!</i>

843
01:09:17,986 --> 01:09:20,826
<i>To their cherished fleet!</i>

844
01:09:20,906 --> 01:09:25,366
<i>All remaining systems
will bow to the First Order!</i>

845
01:09:25,446 --> 01:09:27,956
<i>And will remember this...</i>

846
01:09:28,076 --> 01:09:33,126
<i>as the last day of the Republic!</i>

847
01:09:34,916 --> 01:09:37,046
Confirm transfer to manual control.

848
01:09:37,126 --> 01:09:38,676
Configure!

849
01:09:38,796 --> 01:09:40,256
<i>Fire!</i>

850
01:10:40,316 --> 01:10:42,986
No. What is it?

851
01:10:59,006 --> 01:11:00,166
It was the Republic.

852
01:11:01,336 --> 01:11:02,966
The First Order, they've done it.

853
01:11:05,346 --> 01:11:06,506
Where's Rey?

854
01:11:23,776 --> 01:11:26,026
What are you doing?

855
01:11:27,026 --> 01:11:29,246
You have to go back.

856
01:11:29,326 --> 01:11:30,446
I'm leaving.

857
01:11:31,206 --> 01:11:32,706
BB-8...

858
01:11:32,786 --> 01:11:33,866
No, you can't.

859
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:36,126
You have to go back,
you're too important.

860
01:11:36,206 --> 01:11:37,376
They'll help you.

861
01:11:52,056 --> 01:11:53,346
I've had this for ages.

862
01:11:57,396 --> 01:11:58,726
Kept it locked away.

863
01:11:59,186 --> 01:12:00,186
Where'd you get that?

864
01:12:01,486 --> 01:12:04,566
A good question. For another time.

865
01:12:05,566 --> 01:12:06,656
Take it.

866
01:12:06,736 --> 01:12:08,236
Find your friend!

867
01:12:15,416 --> 01:12:17,416
Those beasts.

868
01:12:17,536 --> 01:12:18,536
They're here.

869
01:12:42,436 --> 01:12:45,106
<i>FN-41</i>7<i>, hold position.</i>

870
01:12:46,946 --> 01:12:48,616
Oh, safety.

871
01:13:14,306 --> 01:13:15,386
<i>Sir.</i>

872
01:13:15,476 --> 01:13:16,806
<i>The droid was spotted heading west.</i>

873
01:13:16,886 --> 01:13:17,896
<i>With a girl.</i>

874
01:13:23,436 --> 01:13:25,896
You have to keep going.
Stay out of sight.

875
01:13:25,986 --> 01:13:28,816
I'll try to fight them off.

876
01:13:28,906 --> 01:13:30,156
I hope so, too.

877
01:13:42,586 --> 01:13:44,506
Come on, Chewie!

878
01:13:46,916 --> 01:13:48,926
Rey and BB-8! They need you!

879
01:13:49,006 --> 01:13:50,006
Now! Go!

880
01:13:50,086 --> 01:13:52,426
I need a weapon!

881
01:13:52,506 --> 01:13:53,966
You have one!

882
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:06,026
Hey, can I try that?

883
01:14:12,526 --> 01:14:13,986
I like this thing.

884
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:21,246
<i>Traitor!</i>

885
01:15:05,996 --> 01:15:07,836
- You okay, Big Deal?
- Thanks.

886
01:15:07,916 --> 01:15:08,916
<i>Don't move.</i>

887
01:15:10,166 --> 01:15:11,926
<i>TK-338, we have targets in custody.</i>

888
01:15:18,096 --> 01:15:20,346
<i>We have incoming at 28. 6.</i>

889
01:15:20,426 --> 01:15:22,436
<i>Move! Move! Move!</i>

890
01:15:23,436 --> 01:15:26,436
<i>Scramble all squads, repeat,
scramble all squads!</i>

891
01:15:26,516 --> 01:15:28,276
<i>Head to higher cover and wait
for our position!</i>

892
01:15:31,106 --> 01:15:32,606
It's the Resistance.

893
01:15:40,446 --> 01:15:42,706
Go straight at them!
Don't let these dogs scare you!

894
01:15:42,786 --> 01:15:44,416
<i>- Copy that.</i>
<i>- We're with you, Poe.</i>

895
01:16:13,146 --> 01:16:14,146
Quick!

896
01:16:42,136 --> 01:16:44,436
Whoo! Yeah!

897
01:16:45,096 --> 01:16:46,936
That's one hell of a pilot!

898
01:16:47,096 --> 01:16:48,356
Whoo-hoo!

899
01:17:42,696 --> 01:17:44,746
<i>The girl I've heard so much about.</i>

900
01:17:57,006 --> 01:17:58,586
<i>The droid.</i>

901
01:18:00,256 --> 01:18:02,546
<i>Where is it?</i>

902
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:09,396
<i>Request air support.</i>

903
01:18:16,526 --> 01:18:17,896
<i>The map.</i>

904
01:18:19,856 --> 01:18:22,026
<i>You've seen it.</i>

905
01:18:22,116 --> 01:18:24,446
<i>Sir, Resistance fighters.</i>

906
01:18:25,406 --> 01:18:26,996
<i>We need more troops.</i>

907
01:18:27,116 --> 01:18:28,956
<i>Pull the division out.</i>

908
01:18:29,076 --> 01:18:32,126
<i>Forget the droid.
We have what we need.</i>

909
01:18:38,966 --> 01:18:40,256
<i>Pull back to tree line!</i>

910
01:18:55,646 --> 01:18:57,186
No!

911
01:19:00,896 --> 01:19:02,316
No, no!

912
01:19:04,236 --> 01:19:06,326
No! No!

913
01:19:07,996 --> 01:19:09,326
Rey!

914
01:19:28,346 --> 01:19:30,346
He took her. Did you see that?

915
01:19:31,186 --> 01:19:32,596
He took her. She's gone.

916
01:19:32,686 --> 01:19:33,846
Yeah, I know.

917
01:19:43,196 --> 01:19:44,526
Let's go.

918
01:19:58,206 --> 01:20:00,706
Goodness! Han Solo!

919
01:20:00,836 --> 01:20:03,006
It is I, C-3PO.

920
01:20:03,546 --> 01:20:05,046
You probably don't recognize me...

921
01:20:05,216 --> 01:20:06,676
because of the red arm.

922
01:20:06,796 --> 01:20:08,716
Look who it is, did you see who...

923
01:20:10,516 --> 01:20:11,516
Uh...

924
01:20:12,056 --> 01:20:13,056
Hmm.

925
01:20:13,186 --> 01:20:16,226
Excuse me, Prin... General. Sorry.

926
01:20:16,306 --> 01:20:18,646
Come along, BB-8, quickly.

927
01:20:18,726 --> 01:20:21,396
Yes, I must get
my proper arm reinstalled.

928
01:20:23,316 --> 01:20:25,066
You changed your hair.

929
01:20:27,406 --> 01:20:28,826
Same jacket.

930
01:20:30,076 --> 01:20:31,866
No, new jacket.

931
01:20:44,836 --> 01:20:45,836
I saw him.

932
01:20:47,756 --> 01:20:49,926
Leia, I saw our son.

933
01:20:51,596 --> 01:20:52,886
He was here.

934
01:21:33,676 --> 01:21:34,676
Hey!

935
01:21:39,266 --> 01:21:41,146
BB-8, my buddy.

936
01:21:41,266 --> 01:21:43,226
Oh, it's so good to see you.

937
01:21:43,316 --> 01:21:44,316
Finn saved you?

938
01:21:44,396 --> 01:21:45,486
Where is he?

939
01:21:45,606 --> 01:21:46,816
Poe?

940
01:21:48,356 --> 01:21:49,356
Oh, no.

941
01:21:49,866 --> 01:21:51,406
Poe Dameron, you're alive?

942
01:21:51,486 --> 01:21:53,656
- Buddy! So are you!
- What happened to you?

943
01:21:53,736 --> 01:21:55,076
I got thrown from the crash.

944
01:21:55,156 --> 01:21:57,076
I woke up at night.
No you. No ship. Nothing.

945
01:21:57,156 --> 01:21:58,536
BB-8 says that you saved him.

946
01:21:58,666 --> 01:22:00,166
No, no, no. It wasn't just me.

947
01:22:00,286 --> 01:22:01,786
You completed my mission, Finn...

948
01:22:01,876 --> 01:22:02,876
That's my jacket.

949
01:22:03,046 --> 01:22:05,416
- Oh...
- No, no, no.

950
01:22:05,506 --> 01:22:07,256
Keep it. It suits you.

951
01:22:08,126 --> 01:22:09,886
You're a good man, Finn.

952
01:22:10,796 --> 01:22:12,756
Poe, I need your help.

953
01:22:14,306 --> 01:22:17,136
<i>PZ-4CO,
report to communications.</i>

954
01:22:20,226 --> 01:22:21,226
General Organa...

955
01:22:23,066 --> 01:22:25,186
I'm sorry to interrupt. This is Finn.

956
01:22:25,316 --> 01:22:28,146
- He needs to talk to you.
- And I need to talk to him.

957
01:22:28,236 --> 01:22:30,026
That was incredibly brave what you did.

958
01:22:30,106 --> 01:22:32,696
Renouncing the First Order,
saving this man's life.

959
01:22:32,816 --> 01:22:34,696
Thank you, ma'am. But a friend
of mine was taken prisoner.

960
01:22:34,826 --> 01:22:36,696
Han told me about the girl.

961
01:22:36,786 --> 01:22:37,906
I'm sorry.

962
01:22:38,036 --> 01:22:40,076
Finn's familiar with the weapon
that destroyed the Hosnian system.

963
01:22:40,166 --> 01:22:41,166
He worked on the base.

964
01:22:41,666 --> 01:22:43,586
We're desperate for anything
you can tell us.

965
01:22:43,706 --> 01:22:44,956
That's where my friend was taken.

966
01:22:45,046 --> 01:22:46,336
I've got to get there fast.

967
01:22:46,456 --> 01:22:47,916
And I will do everything I can to help...

968
01:22:48,006 --> 01:22:50,216
but first you need to tell us
all you know.

969
01:22:53,216 --> 01:22:54,926
That sounds very scary.

970
01:22:57,056 --> 01:22:59,176
You must be so brave.

971
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:03,016
General...

972
01:23:03,146 --> 01:23:04,516
I regret to inform you...

973
01:23:04,606 --> 01:23:06,226
but this map recovered from BB-8...

974
01:23:06,316 --> 01:23:07,816
is only partially complete.

975
01:23:07,896 --> 01:23:11,656
And even worse, it matches
no charted system on record.

976
01:23:11,736 --> 01:23:13,866
We simply do not have
enough information...

977
01:23:13,946 --> 01:23:15,446
to locate Master Luke.

978
01:23:16,536 --> 01:23:18,536
Can't believe I was so foolish
to think I could find Luke...

979
01:23:18,616 --> 01:23:19,616
and bring him home.

980
01:23:19,746 --> 01:23:20,866
Leia.

981
01:23:20,956 --> 01:23:22,036
Don't do that.

982
01:23:22,116 --> 01:23:23,326
Do what?

983
01:23:23,416 --> 01:23:24,536
Anything.

984
01:23:25,956 --> 01:23:27,836
Princesses.

985
01:23:27,956 --> 01:23:29,506
I'm trying to be helpful.

986
01:23:30,666 --> 01:23:31,756
When did that ever help?

987
01:23:31,836 --> 01:23:33,546
And don't say the Death Star.

988
01:23:48,776 --> 01:23:49,776
BB-8.

989
01:23:49,896 --> 01:23:52,946
You're wasting your time.

990
01:23:53,026 --> 01:23:54,776
It is very doubtful that R2 would have

991
01:23:54,946 --> 01:23:56,116
the rest of the map in his backup data.

992
01:23:56,276 --> 01:23:58,406
I am afraid not.

993
01:23:58,486 --> 01:24:02,536
R2-D2 has been in low-power mode
ever since Master Luke went away.

994
01:24:05,126 --> 01:24:08,376
Sadly, he may never be
his old self again.

995
01:24:10,086 --> 01:24:11,716
Listen to me, will you?

996
01:24:12,716 --> 01:24:15,046
I know every time you...

997
01:24:17,256 --> 01:24:19,636
Every time you look at me
you're reminded of him.

998
01:24:19,716 --> 01:24:21,726
You think I want to forget him?

999
01:24:21,806 --> 01:24:23,476
I want him back.

1000
01:24:23,596 --> 01:24:25,686
There's nothing more we could
have done.

1001
01:24:27,436 --> 01:24:28,816
There's too much Vader in him.

1002
01:24:28,896 --> 01:24:31,816
That's why I wanted him
to train with Luke.

1003
01:24:31,896 --> 01:24:33,606
I just never should have sent him away.

1004
01:24:33,696 --> 01:24:35,276
That's when I lost him.

1005
01:24:36,526 --> 01:24:38,526
That's when I lost you both.

1006
01:24:40,616 --> 01:24:43,286
We both had to deal with it
in our own way.

1007
01:24:44,286 --> 01:24:47,246
I went back to the only thing
I was ever any good at.

1008
01:24:47,826 --> 01:24:49,036
We both did.

1009
01:24:51,246 --> 01:24:53,006
We lost our son.

1010
01:24:53,086 --> 01:24:54,256
Forever.

1011
01:24:54,336 --> 01:24:55,336
No.

1012
01:24:55,466 --> 01:24:57,006
It was Snoke.

1013
01:24:57,466 --> 01:25:00,096
He seduced our son to the dark side.

1014
01:25:00,176 --> 01:25:01,766
But we can still save him.

1015
01:25:02,466 --> 01:25:03,596
Me.

1016
01:25:04,516 --> 01:25:05,556
You.

1017
01:25:06,386 --> 01:25:08,726
If Luke couldn't reach him, how could I?

1018
01:25:08,806 --> 01:25:10,226
Luke is a Jedi.

1019
01:25:11,816 --> 01:25:13,146
You're his father.

1020
01:25:15,856 --> 01:25:19,656
There is still light in him, I know it.

1021
01:25:19,736 --> 01:25:21,446
General...

1022
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:24,036
the reconnaissance report
on the enemy base is coming.

1023
01:25:50,856 --> 01:25:51,856
Where am I?

1024
01:25:54,186 --> 01:25:55,526
<i>You're my guest.</i>

1025
01:25:55,606 --> 01:25:56,946
Where are the others?

1026
01:25:57,026 --> 01:25:58,696
<i>Do you mean the murderers...</i>

1027
01:25:58,776 --> 01:26:01,656
<i>traitors, and thieves you call friends?</i>

1028
01:26:02,616 --> 01:26:05,076
<i>You'll be relieved to hear
I have no idea.</i>

1029
01:26:07,076 --> 01:26:09,166
<i>You still want to kill me.</i>

1030
01:26:09,956 --> 01:26:11,626
That happens
when you're being hunted...

1031
01:26:11,706 --> 01:26:13,626
by a creature in a mask.

1032
01:26:38,566 --> 01:26:40,406
Tell me about the droid.

1033
01:26:41,236 --> 01:26:43,066
He's a BB unit with a selenium drive...

1034
01:26:43,156 --> 01:26:44,486
and a thermal hyperscan vindicator.

1035
01:26:44,576 --> 01:26:46,696
It's carrying a section
of a navigational chart.

1036
01:26:46,786 --> 01:26:48,156
And we have the rest.

1037
01:26:48,246 --> 01:26:50,036
Recovered from the archives
of the Empire...

1038
01:26:50,116 --> 01:26:51,206
but we need the last piece.

1039
01:26:51,286 --> 01:26:53,746
And somehow you convinced
the droid to show it to you.

1040
01:26:55,376 --> 01:26:56,376
You.

1041
01:26:57,836 --> 01:26:59,086
A scavenger.

1042
01:27:01,426 --> 01:27:03,546
You know I can take whatever I want.

1043
01:27:09,676 --> 01:27:11,596
You're so lonely.

1044
01:27:13,606 --> 01:27:15,106
So afraid to leave.

1045
01:27:19,276 --> 01:27:22,196
At night, desperate to sleep.

1046
01:27:25,326 --> 01:27:26,906
You imagine an ocean.

1047
01:27:27,866 --> 01:27:29,156
I see it.

1048
01:27:30,406 --> 01:27:32,166
I see the island.

1049
01:27:36,746 --> 01:27:38,046
And Han Solo.

1050
01:27:40,376 --> 01:27:42,546
You feel like he's the father
you never had.

1051
01:27:43,176 --> 01:27:44,676
He would have disappointed you.

1052
01:27:44,796 --> 01:27:46,096
Get out of my head.

1053
01:27:47,216 --> 01:27:48,766
I know you've seen the map.

1054
01:27:50,346 --> 01:27:51,516
It's in there.

1055
01:27:52,436 --> 01:27:53,686
And now you'll give it to me.

1056
01:28:02,316 --> 01:28:04,356
Don't be afraid. I feel it, too.

1057
01:28:06,826 --> 01:28:09,326
I'm not giving you anything.

1058
01:28:09,946 --> 01:28:11,036
We'll see.

1059
01:28:51,036 --> 01:28:52,036
You.

1060
01:28:53,116 --> 01:28:54,116
You're afraid.

1061
01:28:57,166 --> 01:29:00,086
That you will never be
as strong as Darth Vader.

1062
01:29:09,256 --> 01:29:11,096
<i>The scavenger...</i>

1063
01:29:11,216 --> 01:29:12,846
resisted you?

1064
01:29:12,926 --> 01:29:14,516
She is strong with the Force.

1065
01:29:14,596 --> 01:29:16,386
Untrained, but stronger than she knows.

1066
01:29:16,476 --> 01:29:17,686
And the droid?

1067
01:29:17,766 --> 01:29:21,106
Ren believed it was no longer
valuable to us.

1068
01:29:21,186 --> 01:29:23,816
That the girl was all we needed.

1069
01:29:23,936 --> 01:29:26,396
As a result, the droid has
most likely been returned...

1070
01:29:26,486 --> 01:29:27,606
to the hands of the enemy.

1071
01:29:27,736 --> 01:29:29,446
They may have the map already.

1072
01:29:29,526 --> 01:29:31,156
Then the Resistance
must be destroyed...

1073
01:29:31,276 --> 01:29:33,286
before they get to Skywalker.

1074
01:29:33,366 --> 01:29:35,246
We have their location.

1075
01:29:35,326 --> 01:29:37,956
We tracked their reconnaissance ship
to the Ileenium system.

1076
01:29:38,956 --> 01:29:40,246
Good.

1077
01:29:40,336 --> 01:29:43,206
Then we will crush them
once and for all.

1078
01:29:43,296 --> 01:29:45,046
Prepare the weapon.

1079
01:29:45,666 --> 01:29:48,466
Supreme Leader, I can get
the map from the girl.

1080
01:29:48,546 --> 01:29:50,346
I just need your guidance.

1081
01:29:51,966 --> 01:29:56,056
If what you say about this girl is true...

1082
01:29:56,676 --> 01:30:01,356
Bring her to me.

1083
01:30:15,326 --> 01:30:17,496
You will remove these restraints...

1084
01:30:17,576 --> 01:30:20,666
and leave this cell with the door open.

1085
01:30:24,416 --> 01:30:26,166
<i>What did you say?</i>

1086
01:30:29,086 --> 01:30:30,586
You will remove these restraints...

1087
01:30:30,676 --> 01:30:33,346
and leave this cell with the door open.

1088
01:30:40,186 --> 01:30:41,726
<i>I'll tighten
those restraints...</i>

1089
01:30:41,856 --> 01:30:43,896
<i>scavenger scum.</i>

1090
01:30:58,196 --> 01:30:59,786
You will remove these restraints...

1091
01:30:59,866 --> 01:31:02,246
and leave this cell with the door open.

1092
01:31:05,956 --> 01:31:07,546
<i>I will remove
these restraints...</i>

1093
01:31:07,626 --> 01:31:09,376
<i>and leave the cell with the door open.</i>

1094
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:21,346
- And you'll drop your weapon.
<i>- And I'll drop my weapon.</i>

1095
01:31:34,066 --> 01:31:35,156
<i>No.</i>

1096
01:31:36,156 --> 01:31:37,156
<i>No.</i>

1097
01:31:39,076 --> 01:31:40,206
<i>Guards!</i>

1098
01:31:42,746 --> 01:31:43,746
<i>Guards!</i>

1099
01:31:48,756 --> 01:31:51,006
Begin charging the weapon.

1100
01:31:51,086 --> 01:31:52,426
Yes, sir.

1101
01:31:52,506 --> 01:31:53,796
Weapon charging.

1102
01:32:13,066 --> 01:32:15,066
The scan data from Snap's
reconnaissance flight...

1103
01:32:15,156 --> 01:32:16,486
confirms Finn's report.

1104
01:32:16,616 --> 01:32:18,576
They've somehow created
a hyper-lightspeed weapon...

1105
01:32:18,656 --> 01:32:19,946
built within the planet itself.

1106
01:32:20,116 --> 01:32:21,076
A laser cannon?

1107
01:32:21,156 --> 01:32:22,996
We're not sure how to describe
a weapon of this scale.

1108
01:32:23,116 --> 01:32:24,116
It's another Death Star.

1109
01:32:24,206 --> 01:32:25,956
I wish that were the case, Major.

1110
01:32:26,036 --> 01:32:27,286
This was the Death Star.

1111
01:32:30,046 --> 01:32:32,546
And this is Starkiller Base.

1112
01:32:33,046 --> 01:32:34,216
So, it's big.

1113
01:32:34,296 --> 01:32:37,386
How is it possible to power
a weapon of that size?

1114
01:32:37,506 --> 01:32:39,636
It uses the power of the sun.

1115
01:32:40,846 --> 01:32:42,016
As the weapon is charged...

1116
01:32:42,136 --> 01:32:44,226
the sun is drained until it disappears.

1117
01:32:44,306 --> 01:32:45,306
Ma'am.

1118
01:32:47,306 --> 01:32:48,356
The First Order...

1119
01:32:48,476 --> 01:32:49,896
they're charging the weapon again now.

1120
01:32:50,856 --> 01:32:52,736
Our system is the next target.

1121
01:32:52,856 --> 01:32:53,856
Oh, my.

1122
01:32:53,946 --> 01:32:55,446
Without the Republic fleet,
we're doomed.

1123
01:32:55,526 --> 01:32:57,316
Okay. How do we blow it up?

1124
01:32:57,406 --> 01:32:59,736
- There's always a way to do that.
- Han's right.

1125
01:32:59,826 --> 01:33:01,486
In order
for that amount of power...

1126
01:33:01,576 --> 01:33:02,946
to be contained...

1127
01:33:03,036 --> 01:33:04,996
that base has to have some
kind of thermal oscillator.

1128
01:33:05,116 --> 01:33:07,286
There is one. Precinct 47.

1129
01:33:07,876 --> 01:33:09,126
Here.

1130
01:33:09,206 --> 01:33:11,166
If we can destroy
that oscillator...

1131
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:14,256
it might destabilize the core
and cripple the weapon.

1132
01:33:14,336 --> 01:33:16,126
- Maybe the planet.
- We'll go in there,

1133
01:33:16,216 --> 01:33:17,546
we'll hit that oscillator
with everything we've got.

1134
01:33:17,676 --> 01:33:19,006
They have defensive shields...

1135
01:33:19,096 --> 01:33:21,056
that our ships cannot penetrate.

1136
01:33:21,176 --> 01:33:22,596
We disable the shields.

1137
01:33:22,676 --> 01:33:24,346
Kid, you worked there.

1138
01:33:24,476 --> 01:33:25,476
What do you got?

1139
01:33:25,556 --> 01:33:26,766
I can do it.

1140
01:33:26,846 --> 01:33:28,096
I like this guy.

1141
01:33:28,226 --> 01:33:30,106
I can disable the shields,
but I have to be there.

1142
01:33:30,186 --> 01:33:31,646
On the planet.

1143
01:33:31,726 --> 01:33:33,356
- We'll get you there.
- Han, how?

1144
01:33:34,106 --> 01:33:35,606
If I told you, you wouldn't like it.

1145
01:33:35,736 --> 01:33:37,606
So we disable the shields...

1146
01:33:37,696 --> 01:33:39,986
we take out the oscillator
and we blow up their big gun.

1147
01:33:40,116 --> 01:33:42,196
All right. Let's go.

1148
01:34:04,716 --> 01:34:06,226
Chewie, check that donal capitator.

1149
01:34:06,306 --> 01:34:07,806
Come on. Let's go.

1150
01:34:07,886 --> 01:34:10,096
Finn, be careful with those.
They're explosives.

1151
01:34:10,226 --> 01:34:11,266
Now you tell me?

1152
01:34:11,396 --> 01:34:14,606
You know, no matter
how much we fought...

1153
01:34:16,026 --> 01:34:18,356
I've always hated watching you leave.

1154
01:34:18,446 --> 01:34:19,656
That's why I did it.

1155
01:34:20,906 --> 01:34:22,406
So you'd miss me.

1156
01:34:25,156 --> 01:34:26,946
I did miss you.

1157
01:34:28,406 --> 01:34:30,206
It wasn't all bad, was it?

1158
01:34:30,286 --> 01:34:31,376
Huh?

1159
01:34:31,456 --> 01:34:34,586
Some of it was... good.

1160
01:34:34,746 --> 01:34:36,416
Pretty good.

1161
01:34:39,756 --> 01:34:42,636
- Some things never change.
- True.

1162
01:34:43,176 --> 01:34:45,176
You still drive me crazy.

1163
01:34:54,356 --> 01:34:56,276
If you see our son...

1164
01:34:58,776 --> 01:35:00,446
bring him home.

1165
01:35:05,866 --> 01:35:08,536
<i>Sir, sensors
triggered in Hangar</i> 7<i>18.</i>

1166
01:35:08,616 --> 01:35:10,286
<i>We're searching the area.</i>

1167
01:35:10,366 --> 01:35:12,496
<i>She's just beginning
to test her powers.</i>

1168
01:35:12,626 --> 01:35:14,286
<i>The longer it takes to find her...</i>

1169
01:35:14,376 --> 01:35:16,046
<i>the more dangerous she becomes.</i>

1170
01:35:21,126 --> 01:35:22,756
<i>All sentry droids...</i>

1171
01:35:22,836 --> 01:35:24,046
<i>all sentry droids...</i>

1172
01:35:24,136 --> 01:35:26,386
<i>resynchronize
to Galactic Standard Time.</i>

1173
01:35:26,466 --> 01:35:28,466
<i>Offset 4</i>7<i>3.</i>

1174
01:35:31,226 --> 01:35:32,306
How are we getting in?

1175
01:35:32,436 --> 01:35:34,396
Their shields have
a fractional refresh rate.

1176
01:35:34,476 --> 01:35:36,146
Keeps anything traveling
slower than lightspeed...

1177
01:35:36,316 --> 01:35:37,646
from getting through.

1178
01:35:38,226 --> 01:35:40,316
We're making our landing
approach at lightspeed?

1179
01:35:41,776 --> 01:35:42,856
Chewie, get ready.

1180
01:35:44,156 --> 01:35:45,316
And... Now!

1181
01:35:49,246 --> 01:35:50,906
I am pulling up!

1182
01:35:57,626 --> 01:35:59,256
I get any higher...

1183
01:35:59,336 --> 01:36:00,586
they'll see us!

1184
01:36:22,526 --> 01:36:24,906
Sir, she was
not found in Hangar 718.

1185
01:36:25,026 --> 01:36:26,116
But all troops are on alert.

1186
01:36:26,196 --> 01:36:27,576
<i>Put every hangar on lockdown.</i>

1187
01:36:27,696 --> 01:36:29,366
<i>She's going to try to steal
a ship to esc...</i>

1188
01:36:31,996 --> 01:36:33,536
<i>Han Solo.</i>

1189
01:36:44,756 --> 01:36:46,466
The flooding tunnel is over that ridge.

1190
01:36:46,546 --> 01:36:47,796
We'll get in that way.

1191
01:36:47,886 --> 01:36:49,806
What was your job
when you were based here?

1192
01:36:49,886 --> 01:36:50,886
Sanitation.

1193
01:36:53,766 --> 01:36:55,476
Sanitation?

1194
01:36:55,556 --> 01:36:57,266
Then how do you know
how to disable the shields?

1195
01:36:57,396 --> 01:36:58,396
I don't.

1196
01:36:58,516 --> 01:37:00,266
I'm just here to get Rey.

1197
01:37:00,396 --> 01:37:03,986
People are counting on us.
The galaxy is counting on us.

1198
01:37:04,066 --> 01:37:05,396
Solo, we'll figure it out.

1199
01:37:06,356 --> 01:37:07,776
We'll use the Force.

1200
01:37:07,906 --> 01:37:09,986
That's not how the Force works.

1201
01:37:11,576 --> 01:37:14,116
Oh, really? You're cold?

1202
01:37:14,286 --> 01:37:15,286
Come on.

1203
01:37:22,706 --> 01:37:24,006
Report.

1204
01:37:24,086 --> 01:37:26,296
Weapon charged in 15 minutes, sir.

1205
01:37:28,756 --> 01:37:29,756
<i>Hey!</i>

1206
01:37:32,926 --> 01:37:35,136
The longer we're here
the less luck we're gonna have.

1207
01:37:35,266 --> 01:37:37,766
- The shields.
- I have an idea about that.

1208
01:37:45,736 --> 01:37:48,196
- You remember me?
<i>- FN-218</i>7.

1209
01:37:48,276 --> 01:37:49,526
Not anymore.

1210
01:37:49,696 --> 01:37:51,026
The name's Finn and I'm in charge.

1211
01:37:51,116 --> 01:37:53,156
I'm in charge now, Phasma.
I'm in charge.

1212
01:37:53,236 --> 01:37:55,246
- Bring it down. Bring it down.
- Yeah.

1213
01:37:55,326 --> 01:37:56,456
Follow me.

1214
01:38:09,636 --> 01:38:11,096
<i>Have you
checked out the new T-1</i>7<i>s?</i>

1215
01:38:11,176 --> 01:38:12,846
<i>The T-1</i>7<i>s,
as far as I can tell...</i>

1216
01:38:12,966 --> 01:38:14,016
<i>are a great improvement.</i>

1217
01:38:14,136 --> 01:38:15,976
<i>Yeah.
That's what they tell you.</i>

1218
01:38:16,096 --> 01:38:17,306
<i>But believe me, they don't hold up.</i>

1219
01:38:17,436 --> 01:38:18,936
<i>- They don't?
- No.</i>

1220
01:38:54,636 --> 01:38:56,386
You want me to blast
that bucket off your head?

1221
01:38:56,466 --> 01:38:57,596
Lower the shields.

1222
01:38:57,676 --> 01:38:59,516
<i>You're making a big mistake.</i>

1223
01:38:59,636 --> 01:39:01,726
Do it.

1224
01:39:05,976 --> 01:39:07,106
Solo, if this works...

1225
01:39:07,186 --> 01:39:09,446
we're not gonna have
a lot of time to find Rey.

1226
01:39:09,526 --> 01:39:10,906
Don't worry, kid.

1227
01:39:11,696 --> 01:39:13,116
We won't leave here without her.

1228
01:39:14,906 --> 01:39:17,786
<i>You can't be so stupid
as to think this will be easy.</i>

1229
01:39:17,866 --> 01:39:20,456
<i>My troops will storm
this block and kill you all.</i>

1230
01:39:20,536 --> 01:39:22,376
I disagree. What do we do with her?

1231
01:39:22,996 --> 01:39:24,536
Is there a garbage chute?

1232
01:39:25,206 --> 01:39:26,546
Trash compactor?

1233
01:39:27,706 --> 01:39:28,796
Yeah, there is.

1234
01:39:29,126 --> 01:39:30,676
General, their shields are down.

1235
01:39:30,756 --> 01:39:32,336
Thank the Maker!

1236
01:39:32,426 --> 01:39:34,176
Han did it. Send them in.

1237
01:39:34,256 --> 01:39:36,176
Give Poe full authorization for attack.

1238
01:39:36,256 --> 01:39:38,556
Black Leader,
go to sub-lights on your call.

1239
01:39:38,636 --> 01:39:39,636
Roger, base.

1240
01:39:39,726 --> 01:39:41,436
Red squad, Blue squad, take my lead.

1241
01:39:41,636 --> 01:39:43,646
Dropping out of lightspeed.

1242
01:39:57,406 --> 01:39:58,906
<i>Almost in range.</i>

1243
01:39:59,076 --> 01:40:01,826
Hit the target dead center.
As many runs as we can get.

1244
01:40:01,906 --> 01:40:03,786
Approaching target.

1245
01:40:07,746 --> 01:40:09,206
Fighters incoming!

1246
01:40:10,086 --> 01:40:11,666
<i>Coming at 28.336.</i>

1247
01:40:11,756 --> 01:40:13,546
Forty-five!
Shields up! Shields up!

1248
01:40:13,626 --> 01:40:15,296
Dispatch all squadrons.

1249
01:40:15,426 --> 01:40:16,926
Yes, General.

1250
01:40:17,756 --> 01:40:18,756
All right. Let's light it up.

1251
01:40:28,516 --> 01:40:30,606
- Ah, direct hit.
- But no damage!

1252
01:40:30,686 --> 01:40:31,936
<i>Yeah, we gotta
keep hitting it.</i>

1253
01:40:32,106 --> 01:40:33,396
Another bombing run.

1254
01:40:33,526 --> 01:40:36,236
<i>Remember, when the sun is gone
that weapon will be ready to fire.</i>

1255
01:40:36,316 --> 01:40:38,906
But as long as there's light,
we got a chance.

1256
01:40:40,616 --> 01:40:42,156
Guys, we got a lot of company!

1257
01:40:48,786 --> 01:40:50,416
<i>We think
they may be splitting up.</i>

1258
01:40:50,496 --> 01:40:52,466
<i>Heading to quadrants 4 and 5.</i>

1259
01:41:00,306 --> 01:41:02,306
We'll use the charges
to blow that blast door.

1260
01:41:02,386 --> 01:41:05,136
I'll go in and draw fire,
but I'm gonna need cover.

1261
01:41:05,226 --> 01:41:06,306
You sure you're up for this?

1262
01:41:06,396 --> 01:41:07,606
Hell, no.

1263
01:41:07,686 --> 01:41:08,976
I'll go in and try to find Rey.

1264
01:41:09,056 --> 01:41:10,266
The troopers will be on our tail.

1265
01:41:10,356 --> 01:41:12,486
We have to be ready for that.

1266
01:41:12,566 --> 01:41:14,356
There's an access tunnel that leads...

1267
01:41:14,446 --> 01:41:16,986
Why are you doing that? Hmm?
Why are you doing this?

1268
01:41:17,066 --> 01:41:18,406
I'm trying to come up with a plan.

1269
01:41:35,126 --> 01:41:36,716
You all right?

1270
01:41:36,796 --> 01:41:38,426
- Yeah.
- Good.

1271
01:41:38,506 --> 01:41:40,096
What happened to you?
Did he hurt you?

1272
01:41:40,176 --> 01:41:41,556
Finn, what are you doing here?

1273
01:41:41,676 --> 01:41:43,766
We came back for you.

1274
01:41:44,636 --> 01:41:46,186
What'd he say?

1275
01:41:46,266 --> 01:41:47,646
That it was your idea.

1276
01:41:51,436 --> 01:41:52,526
Thank you.

1277
01:41:56,396 --> 01:41:57,986
How did you get away?

1278
01:41:58,066 --> 01:41:59,106
I can't explain it.

1279
01:41:59,196 --> 01:42:01,276
And you wouldn't believe it.

1280
01:42:01,366 --> 01:42:03,696
Escape now, hug later.

1281
01:42:18,876 --> 01:42:20,426
I got one behind me.

1282
01:42:20,546 --> 01:42:21,926
<i>- You see it?</i>
- Yeah. I'm on it.

1283
01:42:30,556 --> 01:42:32,396
- Burillo's been hit.
- Watch out for ground fire.

1284
01:42:37,316 --> 01:42:39,276
They're in trouble.

1285
01:42:39,356 --> 01:42:40,776
We can't leave.

1286
01:42:42,576 --> 01:42:45,576
My friend's got a bag full of explosives.

1287
01:42:45,656 --> 01:42:47,326
Let's use them.

1288
01:42:47,406 --> 01:42:48,786
General, are you seeing this?

1289
01:42:48,906 --> 01:42:50,246
Two more X-wings down.

1290
01:42:50,326 --> 01:42:52,706
That's half our fleet destroyed.

1291
01:42:52,786 --> 01:42:55,456
And their weapon
will be fully charged in ten minutes.

1292
01:42:55,546 --> 01:42:57,666
It would take a miracle to save us now.

1293
01:43:24,116 --> 01:43:25,116
Ah.

1294
01:43:25,196 --> 01:43:27,536
Girl knows her stuff.

1295
01:43:36,496 --> 01:43:38,956
We'll set the charges
against every other column.

1296
01:43:40,166 --> 01:43:42,126
You're right. That's a better idea.

1297
01:43:42,216 --> 01:43:44,216
You take the top. I'll go down below.

1298
01:43:44,296 --> 01:43:45,966
Detonator.

1299
01:43:46,056 --> 01:43:47,716
We'll meet back here.

1300
01:44:33,136 --> 01:44:34,136
<i>Find them.</i>

1301
01:45:35,906 --> 01:45:36,916
Ben!

1302
01:45:49,676 --> 01:45:50,796
<i>Han Solo.</i>

1303
01:45:51,506 --> 01:45:54,386
<i>I've been waiting for this day
for a long time.</i>

1304
01:46:13,656 --> 01:46:17,156
Take off that mask. You don't need it.

1305
01:46:17,746 --> 01:46:19,626
<i>What do you think you'll see if I do?</i>

1306
01:46:19,746 --> 01:46:21,996
The face of my son.

1307
01:46:43,856 --> 01:46:46,026
Your son is gone.

1308
01:46:47,316 --> 01:46:49,656
He was weak and foolish like his father.

1309
01:46:49,816 --> 01:46:51,566
So I destroyed him.

1310
01:46:53,656 --> 01:46:56,036
That's what Snoke wants you to believe.

1311
01:46:57,286 --> 01:46:58,996
But it's not true.

1312
01:47:00,326 --> 01:47:02,416
My son is alive.

1313
01:47:02,496 --> 01:47:03,956
No.

1314
01:47:04,036 --> 01:47:06,256
The Supreme Leader is wise.

1315
01:47:06,336 --> 01:47:09,086
Snoke is using you for your power.

1316
01:47:09,166 --> 01:47:10,966
When he gets what he wants,
he'll crush you.

1317
01:47:16,216 --> 01:47:17,886
You know it's true.

1318
01:47:23,516 --> 01:47:24,516
It's too late.

1319
01:47:24,606 --> 01:47:26,186
No, it's not.

1320
01:47:26,276 --> 01:47:28,026
Leave here with me. Come home.

1321
01:47:29,776 --> 01:47:31,196
We miss you.

1322
01:47:39,906 --> 01:47:42,036
I'm being torn apart.

1323
01:47:44,876 --> 01:47:47,046
I want to be free of this pain.

1324
01:47:52,466 --> 01:47:53,506
I know what I have to do...

1325
01:47:53,586 --> 01:47:55,716
but I don't know if I have
the strength to do it.

1326
01:47:59,636 --> 01:48:00,726
Will you help me?

1327
01:48:00,806 --> 01:48:02,636
Yes. Anything.

1328
01:48:50,936 --> 01:48:53,776
No!

1329
01:49:00,696 --> 01:49:01,946
Thank you.

1330
01:49:09,456 --> 01:49:10,456
No.

1331
01:50:25,786 --> 01:50:27,366
The oscillator's been damaged...

1332
01:50:27,456 --> 01:50:29,206
but is still functional.

1333
01:50:29,286 --> 01:50:31,786
Admiral, their weapon
will fire in two minutes.

1334
01:50:43,056 --> 01:50:44,506
The <i>Falcon's</i> this way.

1335
01:51:05,406 --> 01:51:06,746
We're not done yet.

1336
01:51:09,916 --> 01:51:11,746
You're a monster.

1337
01:51:11,876 --> 01:51:13,746
It's just us now.

1338
01:51:14,916 --> 01:51:16,416
Han Solo can't save you.

1339
01:51:25,216 --> 01:51:27,016
Rey!

1340
01:51:29,806 --> 01:51:31,306
Rey.

1341
01:51:31,396 --> 01:51:32,396
Rey!

1342
01:51:34,226 --> 01:51:35,856
Oh, no. No, no.

1343
01:51:35,936 --> 01:51:36,936
Rey.

1344
01:51:39,146 --> 01:51:40,696
Traitor!

1345
01:51:51,246 --> 01:51:52,786
That lightsaber.

1346
01:51:53,916 --> 01:51:54,956
It belongs to me.

1347
01:51:55,036 --> 01:51:56,706
Come get it.

1348
01:53:44,526 --> 01:53:45,606
We just lost <i>R-1.</i>

1349
01:53:46,236 --> 01:53:47,526
<i>We're overwhelmed.</i>

1350
01:53:47,606 --> 01:53:48,906
What do we do? It isn't working.

1351
01:53:49,656 --> 01:53:51,866
Black Leader, there's a brand
new hole in that oscillator.

1352
01:53:52,906 --> 01:53:54,826
<i>Looks like our friends got in.</i>

1353
01:53:55,456 --> 01:53:57,326
Red Four, Red Six, cover us.

1354
01:53:57,416 --> 01:53:58,576
- I'm on it.
- Roger.

1355
01:53:58,666 --> 01:54:00,206
Everybody else, hit the target hard.

1356
01:54:00,286 --> 01:54:01,336
Give it everything you got.

1357
01:54:14,216 --> 01:54:15,596
I need some help here.
I need some help!

1358
01:54:15,676 --> 01:54:16,936
- Coming in!
- Watch out!

1359
01:54:18,136 --> 01:54:19,396
I'm hit!

1360
01:54:24,896 --> 01:54:26,816
All teams, I'm going in.

1361
01:54:26,946 --> 01:54:28,106
<i>Pull up and cover me.</i>

1362
01:54:28,196 --> 01:54:29,946
Copy that, Black Leader.
Good luck, Poe.

1363
01:54:36,076 --> 01:54:37,956
Weapon fully charged in 30 seconds.

1364
01:54:39,456 --> 01:54:40,626
Prepare to fire.

1365
01:56:13,716 --> 01:56:15,136
You need a teacher.

1366
01:56:17,006 --> 01:56:18,806
I could show you the ways of the Force.

1367
01:56:21,426 --> 01:56:22,516
The Force?

1368
01:58:11,286 --> 01:58:12,706
All eyes on that TIE fighter.

1369
01:58:12,796 --> 01:58:14,376
We're losing power rapidly!

1370
01:58:16,756 --> 01:58:18,676
Lieutenant!
Get back to your station!

1371
01:58:18,756 --> 01:58:22,056
Just look! We won't survive.
Even Hux is gone.

1372
01:58:22,176 --> 01:58:23,676
Supreme Leader.

1373
01:58:24,556 --> 01:58:26,516
The fuel cells have ruptured.

1374
01:58:26,596 --> 01:58:28,726
The collapse of the planet has begun.

1375
01:58:28,936 --> 01:58:32,976
Leave the base at once
and come to me with Kylo Ren.

1376
01:58:34,066 --> 01:58:35,936
It is time...

1377
01:58:36,026 --> 01:58:38,356
to complete his training.

1378
01:58:40,696 --> 01:58:41,696
Finn!

1379
01:58:42,446 --> 01:58:43,656
Finn.

1380
01:59:32,786 --> 01:59:35,876
- All teams, I got eyes on them.
- Yes!

1381
01:59:58,816 --> 02:00:01,946
Our job's done here. Let's go home.

1382
02:00:17,126 --> 02:00:19,456
Easy, easy. He's hurt.

1383
02:00:19,586 --> 02:00:20,796
We've got a heartbeat.

1384
02:01:22,856 --> 02:01:24,486
R2-D2!

1385
02:01:25,356 --> 02:01:26,356
You've come back.

1386
02:01:30,326 --> 02:01:31,736
You found what?

1387
02:01:31,866 --> 02:01:33,866
How dare you call me that!

1388
02:01:36,246 --> 02:01:38,326
Find Master Luke, how?

1389
02:01:38,416 --> 02:01:39,456
Come, R2.

1390
02:01:39,536 --> 02:01:41,546
We must go tell the others at once!

1391
02:01:42,876 --> 02:01:43,966
General.

1392
02:01:44,046 --> 02:01:46,216
Excuse me, General.

1393
02:01:50,806 --> 02:01:53,306
R2 may contain some
much-needed good news.

1394
02:01:53,976 --> 02:01:55,436
Tell me.

1395
02:02:05,816 --> 02:02:07,236
Yeah. All right, buddy. Hold on.

1396
02:02:21,666 --> 02:02:23,296
The map, it is complete.

1397
02:02:23,916 --> 02:02:25,586
Luke.

1398
02:02:25,666 --> 02:02:27,256
Oh, my dear friend...

1399
02:02:27,376 --> 02:02:28,926
how I've missed you.

1400
02:02:45,896 --> 02:02:47,946
We'll see each other again.

1401
02:02:48,026 --> 02:02:49,946
I believe that.

1402
02:02:58,116 --> 02:02:59,916
Thank you, my friend.

1403
02:03:14,806 --> 02:03:16,636
Rey.

1404
02:03:18,306 --> 02:03:21,096
May the Force be with you.

1405
02:03:24,096 --> 02:03:28,096
