2
00:02:56,946 --> 00:02:59,276
This will begin to make things right.

3
00:03:00,196 --> 00:03:03,196
I've traveled too far and seen too much

4
00:03:03,276 --> 00:03:06,246
to ignore the despair in the galaxy.

5
00:03:06,366 --> 00:03:10,206
Without the Jedi, there can be
no balance in the Force.

6
00:03:11,036 --> 00:03:13,586
Well, because of you,
now we have a chance.

7
00:03:13,706 --> 00:03:15,456
The General's been after this
for a long time.

8
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,336
Oh, the General?

9
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,796
To me, she is royalty.

10
00:03:20,216 --> 00:03:21,796
Well, she certainly is that.

11
00:03:27,636 --> 00:03:28,806
We got company.

12
00:03:41,866 --> 00:03:43,406
You have to hide.

13
00:03:43,526 --> 00:03:44,946
You have to leave.

14
00:03:47,076 --> 00:03:48,076
Go.

15
00:04:19,436 --> 00:04:21,776
Come on, BB-8, hurry!

16
00:04:34,036 --> 00:04:35,166
<i>Blast thatX-wing!</i>

17
00:04:35,246 --> 00:04:36,416
<i>Over there! Over there!</i>

18
00:04:41,466 --> 00:04:43,546
I see them.

19
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,126
You take this.

20
00:05:16,206 --> 00:05:18,166
It's safer with you than it is with me.

21
00:05:18,996 --> 00:05:21,126
You get as far away from here
as you can.

22
00:05:22,296 --> 00:05:24,006
Do you hear me?

23
00:05:24,126 --> 00:05:25,506
I'll come back for you.

24
00:05:26,176 --> 00:05:27,546
It will be all right.

25
00:06:26,606 --> 00:06:27,906
<i>Keep moving!</i>

26
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:31,406
<i>Stay here.</i>

27
00:06:54,806 --> 00:06:57,686
<i>Look how old you've become.</i>

28
00:06:58,346 --> 00:07:01,306
Something far worse
has happened to you.

29
00:07:02,106 --> 00:07:04,106
<i>You know what I've come for.</i>

30
00:07:04,476 --> 00:07:06,396
I know where you come from.

31
00:07:06,486 --> 00:07:08,446
Before you called yourself Kylo Ren.

32
00:07:08,946 --> 00:07:12,526
<i>The map to Skywalker.
We know you found it.</i>

33
00:07:13,696 --> 00:07:16,446
<i>And now you're going
to give it to the First Order.</i>

34
00:07:16,576 --> 00:07:19,036
The First Order rose from the dark side.

35
00:07:19,116 --> 00:07:20,116
You did not.

36
00:07:21,286 --> 00:07:23,796
<i>I'll show you the dark side.</i>

37
00:07:24,456 --> 00:07:26,126
You may try.

38
00:07:26,206 --> 00:07:30,216
But you cannot deny
the truth that is your family.

39
00:07:30,966 --> 00:07:32,006
<i>You're so right.</i>

40
00:08:06,046 --> 00:08:08,336
So, who talks first?
You talk first? I talk first?

41
00:08:09,506 --> 00:08:11,376
<i>The old man gave it to you.</i>

42
00:08:11,546 --> 00:08:13,136
It's just very hard to
understand you with all the...

43
00:08:13,216 --> 00:08:14,846
<i>- Search him.</i>
- ...apparatus.

44
00:08:18,886 --> 00:08:20,766
<i>- Nothing, sir.</i>
<i>- Put him on board.</i>

45
00:08:26,896 --> 00:08:29,396
<i>Sir, the villagers?</i>

46
00:08:31,986 --> 00:08:33,196
<i>Kill them all.</i>

47
00:08:34,696 --> 00:08:36,276
<i>On my command.</i>

48
00:08:37,236 --> 00:08:38,616
<i>Fire.</i>

49
00:08:38,696 --> 00:08:40,706
Please, no!

50
00:09:09,186 --> 00:09:10,986
<i>Nothing here.
Go ahead!</i>

51
00:09:52,026 --> 00:09:53,106
All right.

52
00:09:53,186 --> 00:09:54,196
All right!

53
00:10:20,096 --> 00:10:21,806
<i>FN-218</i>7.

54
00:10:22,466 --> 00:10:24,976
<i>Submit your blaster for inspection.</i>

55
00:10:25,636 --> 00:10:26,886
Yes, Captain.

56
00:10:27,436 --> 00:10:30,146
<i>And who gave you permission
to remove that helmet?</i>

57
00:10:30,816 --> 00:10:31,816
I'm sorry, Captain.

58
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:33,986
<i>Report to my division at once.</i>

59
00:13:19,686 --> 00:13:22,946
What you brought
me today is worth...

60
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:24,736
hmm...

61
00:13:25,986 --> 00:13:28,776
one quarter portion.

62
00:15:26,066 --> 00:15:28,446
Shh.

63
00:15:30,486 --> 00:15:32,776
That's just Teedo. Wants you for parts.

64
00:15:33,486 --> 00:15:35,076
He has no respect for anyone.

65
00:15:38,786 --> 00:15:39,866
Your antenna's bent.

66
00:15:49,626 --> 00:15:50,676
Where do you come from?

67
00:15:54,466 --> 00:15:56,266
Classified, really?

68
00:15:56,346 --> 00:15:57,636
Me too. Big secret.

69
00:15:58,556 --> 00:16:01,646
Niima Outpost is that way.
Stay off Kelvin Ridge.

70
00:16:01,806 --> 00:16:03,606
Keep away from
the Sinking Fields in the north.

71
00:16:03,766 --> 00:16:05,186
You'll drown in the sand.

72
00:16:10,526 --> 00:16:13,406
Don't follow me. Town is that way.

73
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:17,616
No!

74
00:16:34,006 --> 00:16:35,636
In the morning, you go.

75
00:16:41,436 --> 00:16:42,556
You're welcome.

76
00:16:54,276 --> 00:16:55,526
<i>I had no idea we had...</i>

77
00:16:55,616 --> 00:16:58,366
<i>the best pilot in
the Resistance on board.</i>

78
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:01,786
<i>Comfortable?</i>

79
00:17:02,366 --> 00:17:03,366
Not really.

80
00:17:04,826 --> 00:17:06,126
<i>I'm impressed.</i>

81
00:17:08,626 --> 00:17:10,336
<i>No one has been able to
get out of you...</i>

82
00:17:11,046 --> 00:17:13,926
<i>what you did with the map.</i>

83
00:17:14,426 --> 00:17:16,756
You might want to rethink
your technique.

84
00:17:32,236 --> 00:17:34,566
<i>Where is it?</i>

85
00:17:36,526 --> 00:17:38,156
The Resistance...

86
00:17:38,236 --> 00:17:40,236
will not be intimidated by you.

87
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:47,206
<i>Where... is it?</i>

88
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,926
<i>It's in a droid. A BB unit.</i>

89
00:18:00,006 --> 00:18:02,466
Well, then, if it's on Jakku,
we'll soon have it.

90
00:18:02,556 --> 00:18:04,226
<i>I leave that to you.</i>

91
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:09,056
Don't give up hope.
He still might show up.

92
00:18:09,146 --> 00:18:11,276
Whoever it is you're waiting for.

93
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:12,816
Classified.

94
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:15,566
I know all about waiting.

95
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:18,616
For my family.

96
00:18:19,276 --> 00:18:22,036
They'll be back. One day.

97
00:18:22,826 --> 00:18:23,826
Come on.

98
00:18:26,826 --> 00:18:29,996
<i>These five pieces are worth...</i>

99
00:18:30,836 --> 00:18:32,956
Let me see here... hmm...

100
00:18:33,336 --> 00:18:36,046
one half portion.

101
00:18:36,126 --> 00:18:37,836
Last week they were a half portion each.

102
00:18:37,966 --> 00:18:39,636
What about the droid?

103
00:18:42,466 --> 00:18:43,516
What about him?

104
00:18:43,636 --> 00:18:45,806
I'll pay for him.

105
00:18:51,686 --> 00:18:53,976
Sixty portions.

106
00:19:05,996 --> 00:19:06,996
Actually...

107
00:19:08,996 --> 00:19:10,916
The droid's not for sale.

108
00:19:13,246 --> 00:19:14,246
Come on.

109
00:19:18,546 --> 00:19:20,926
Follow the girl and get that droid.

110
00:19:24,766 --> 00:19:26,226
<i>Ren wants the prisoner.</i>

111
00:19:35,606 --> 00:19:36,736
<i>Turn here.</i>

112
00:19:38,696 --> 00:19:39,696
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

113
00:19:39,776 --> 00:19:42,026
<i>If you do exactly as I say,
I can get you out of here.</i>

114
00:19:42,116 --> 00:19:43,116
What?

115
00:19:44,366 --> 00:19:46,446
This is a rescue. I'm helping you escape.

116
00:19:46,536 --> 00:19:48,286
Can you fly a TIE fighter?

117
00:19:48,366 --> 00:19:49,416
You're with the Resistance?

118
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:51,456
What? No, no, no. I'm breaking you out.

119
00:19:51,536 --> 00:19:53,536
- Can you fly a TIE fighter?
- I can fly anything.

120
00:19:54,286 --> 00:19:56,876
Why? Why are you helping me?

121
00:19:58,256 --> 00:19:59,966
Because it's the right thing to do.

122
00:20:00,876 --> 00:20:01,926
You need a pilot.

123
00:20:02,046 --> 00:20:03,386
I need a pilot.

124
00:20:04,886 --> 00:20:05,966
We're gonna do this.

125
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:07,306
Yeah?

126
00:20:11,596 --> 00:20:13,806
<i>Okay. Stay calm. Stay calm.</i>

127
00:20:13,896 --> 00:20:16,396
- I am calm.
<i>- I'm talking to myself.</i>

128
00:20:18,896 --> 00:20:19,896
<i>Not yet.</i>

129
00:20:21,776 --> 00:20:23,486
<i>Okay, go. This way.</i>

130
00:20:29,746 --> 00:20:31,826
I've always wanted to fly
one of these things.

131
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,996
- Can you shoot?
- Blasters, I can.

132
00:20:34,076 --> 00:20:35,416
Okay, same principle.

133
00:20:35,496 --> 00:20:36,496
Use the toggle on the left...

134
00:20:36,586 --> 00:20:38,256
to switch between missiles,
cannons and mag pulse.

135
00:20:38,376 --> 00:20:39,796
Use the sight on the right to aim.

136
00:20:40,216 --> 00:20:42,006
- Triggers to fire.
- This is very complicated.

137
00:20:48,596 --> 00:20:49,676
I can fix this.

138
00:20:53,016 --> 00:20:55,516
We have an unsanctioned
departure from bay two.

139
00:20:55,606 --> 00:20:58,356
Alert General Hux. And stop that fighter.

140
00:21:19,046 --> 00:21:20,126
Fourteen failed. Eighteen...

141
00:21:22,216 --> 00:21:23,296
I got it.

142
00:21:27,216 --> 00:21:28,756
This thing really moves.

143
00:21:33,346 --> 00:21:35,516
We gotta take out as many of
these cannons as we can...

144
00:21:35,686 --> 00:21:36,726
or we're not gonna get very far.

145
00:21:36,806 --> 00:21:38,226
- All right.
- I'm gonna get us in position.

146
00:21:38,316 --> 00:21:39,316
Just stay sharp.

147
00:21:42,526 --> 00:21:44,106
Up ahead! Up ahead! You see it?

148
00:21:44,196 --> 00:21:45,236
I got us dead center.

149
00:21:45,316 --> 00:21:46,446
- It's a clean shot.
- Okay, got it.

150
00:21:55,206 --> 00:21:56,626
- Yeah!
- Yes!

151
00:21:56,706 --> 00:21:57,786
Did you see that?

152
00:21:57,876 --> 00:21:59,496
- Did you see that?
- I saw it!

153
00:22:05,176 --> 00:22:06,296
Hey, what's your name?

154
00:22:06,386 --> 00:22:07,636
FN-2187.

155
00:22:07,716 --> 00:22:08,926
F... What?

156
00:22:09,006 --> 00:22:10,846
That's the only name they ever gave me.

157
00:22:10,966 --> 00:22:13,426
Well, I ain't using it. F-N, huh?

158
00:22:13,516 --> 00:22:15,016
Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn.

159
00:22:15,096 --> 00:22:16,726
- Is that all right?
- Finn.

160
00:22:16,806 --> 00:22:18,476
Yeah. Finn, I like that.

161
00:22:18,556 --> 00:22:20,726
- I like that.
- I'm Poe. Poe Dameron.

162
00:22:20,816 --> 00:22:22,726
- Good to meet you, Poe.
- Good to meet you too, Finn.

163
00:22:26,316 --> 00:22:28,736
Sir, they've
taken out our turbolasers.

164
00:22:29,526 --> 00:22:30,906
Use the ventral cannons.

165
00:22:31,236 --> 00:22:33,156
Yes, sir. Bringing them online.

166
00:22:33,246 --> 00:22:35,956
<i>General Hux,
is it the Resistance pilot?</i>

167
00:22:36,036 --> 00:22:38,456
Yes, and he had help...

168
00:22:38,536 --> 00:22:39,916
from one of our own.

169
00:22:40,706 --> 00:22:41,916
We're checking the registers now...

170
00:22:42,046 --> 00:22:43,916
to identify which stormtrooper it was.

171
00:22:44,046 --> 00:22:47,426
<i>The one from the village. FN-218</i>7.

172
00:22:48,046 --> 00:22:49,846
Sir, ventral cannons hot.

173
00:22:50,386 --> 00:22:51,386
Fire.

174
00:23:00,766 --> 00:23:02,436
One's coming toward you!
My right. Your left.

175
00:23:02,516 --> 00:23:04,276
- Do you see it?
- Hold on.

176
00:23:04,396 --> 00:23:05,396
I see him!

177
00:23:08,776 --> 00:23:10,276
Nice shot!

178
00:23:16,616 --> 00:23:17,706
Where are we going?

179
00:23:17,826 --> 00:23:18,956
We're going back to Jakku.
That's where.

180
00:23:19,076 --> 00:23:20,626
No. We can't go back to Jakku.

181
00:23:20,706 --> 00:23:22,166
We need to get out of this system.

182
00:23:22,246 --> 00:23:24,126
I gotta get my droid
before the First Order does.

183
00:23:24,246 --> 00:23:25,506
- What, a droid?
- That's right.

184
00:23:25,586 --> 00:23:27,796
He's a BB unit, orange and
white. One of a kind.

185
00:23:27,926 --> 00:23:28,926
I don't care what color he is!

186
00:23:29,006 --> 00:23:30,256
No droid can be that important.

187
00:23:30,336 --> 00:23:31,346
This one is, pal!

188
00:23:31,426 --> 00:23:33,096
We gotta get as far away from
the First Order as we can.

189
00:23:33,216 --> 00:23:34,506
We go back to Jakku, we die.

190
00:23:34,596 --> 00:23:37,306
That droid has a map
that leads straight to Luke Skywalker.

191
00:23:37,386 --> 00:23:39,306
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

192
00:23:42,396 --> 00:23:45,476
<i>FN-218</i>7 <i>reported
to my division...</i>

193
00:23:45,606 --> 00:23:47,896
<i>was evaluated,
and sent to reconditioning.</i>

194
00:23:47,986 --> 00:23:50,236
No prior signs of nonconformity?

195
00:23:50,316 --> 00:23:52,236
<i>This was his first offense.</i>

196
00:23:52,316 --> 00:23:53,446
General!

197
00:23:53,526 --> 00:23:54,906
- They've been hit.
- Destroyed?

198
00:23:54,986 --> 00:23:56,246
Disabled.

199
00:23:56,326 --> 00:23:57,746
They were headed back to Jakku.

200
00:23:57,826 --> 00:24:00,036
The fighter is projected to
crash in the Goazon badlands.

201
00:24:00,116 --> 00:24:01,786
They were going back for the droid.

202
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:03,836
Send a squad to the wreckage.

203
00:24:26,186 --> 00:24:27,356
Poe!

204
00:24:28,686 --> 00:24:29,986
Poe!

205
00:24:30,816 --> 00:24:31,856
Poe!

206
00:24:35,326 --> 00:24:36,826
Poe! I got you.

207
00:24:38,996 --> 00:24:39,996
Poe!

208
00:24:46,836 --> 00:24:47,876
Poe!

209
00:26:12,086 --> 00:26:14,296
<i>Supreme Leader Snoke
was explicit.</i>

210
00:26:14,466 --> 00:26:16,886
Capture the droid if we can,
but destroy it if we must.

211
00:26:16,966 --> 00:26:18,756
<i>How capable
are your soldiers, General?</i>

212
00:26:18,886 --> 00:26:20,346
I won't have you question my methods.

213
00:26:20,426 --> 00:26:22,466
<i>They're obviously skilled
at committing high treason.</i>

214
00:26:22,596 --> 00:26:25,386
<i>Perhaps Leader Snoke should
consider using a clone army.</i>

215
00:26:25,516 --> 00:26:26,556
My men are exceptionally trained.

216
00:26:26,646 --> 00:26:27,846
Programmed from birth.

217
00:26:27,936 --> 00:26:30,226
<i>Then they should have
no problem retrieving the droid.</i>

218
00:26:30,316 --> 00:26:31,316
<i>Unharmed.</i>

219
00:26:32,396 --> 00:26:34,566
Careful, Ren, that your
personal interests...

220
00:26:34,646 --> 00:26:37,106
not interfere with orders
from Leader Snoke.

221
00:26:37,276 --> 00:26:39,696
<i>I want that map.</i>

222
00:26:39,776 --> 00:26:41,156
<i>For your sake...</i>

223
00:26:41,276 --> 00:26:42,486
<i>I suggest you get it.</i>

224
00:26:49,076 --> 00:26:50,246
Water. Water.

225
00:26:50,336 --> 00:26:51,376
No water.

226
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:52,956
Water.

227
00:26:54,836 --> 00:26:55,916
Is there water?

228
00:27:24,366 --> 00:27:26,706
What? Oi, get off him!

229
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:37,166
Hey!

230
00:27:53,566 --> 00:27:55,606
They work for Unkar.

231
00:27:55,726 --> 00:27:57,486
That guy that wanted you.

232
00:27:57,566 --> 00:27:59,196
He must have really wanted you.

233
00:28:01,566 --> 00:28:03,446
Who?

234
00:28:04,366 --> 00:28:06,536
Him?

235
00:28:25,346 --> 00:28:28,516
- What's your hurry, thief?
- What? Thief?

236
00:28:28,676 --> 00:28:30,136
Ow!

237
00:28:30,226 --> 00:28:31,516
- Hey, what?
- The jacket.

238
00:28:31,596 --> 00:28:33,096
This droid says you stole it.

239
00:28:34,056 --> 00:28:35,726
I've had a pretty messed up
day, all right?

240
00:28:35,856 --> 00:28:36,936
So I'd appreciate it...

241
00:28:37,066 --> 00:28:38,276
if you stop accusing me of...

242
00:28:38,396 --> 00:28:40,816
- Ow! Stop it!
- Where'd you get it?

243
00:28:40,896 --> 00:28:42,236
It belongs to his master.

244
00:28:45,526 --> 00:28:48,616
It belonged to Poe Dameron.
That was his name, right?

245
00:28:50,656 --> 00:28:53,286
He was captured by the First Order.

246
00:28:53,416 --> 00:28:55,996
I helped him escape,
but our ship crashed.

247
00:28:59,126 --> 00:29:00,256
Poe didn't make it.

248
00:29:05,096 --> 00:29:07,256
I tried to help him. I'm sorry.

249
00:29:15,436 --> 00:29:17,146
So you're with the Resistance?

250
00:29:21,776 --> 00:29:23,106
Obviously.

251
00:29:23,276 --> 00:29:24,566
Yes, I am.

252
00:29:24,656 --> 00:29:25,946
I'm with the Resistance, yeah.

253
00:29:26,066 --> 00:29:28,116
I am with the Resistance.

254
00:29:29,326 --> 00:29:31,746
I've never met
a Resistance fighter before.

255
00:29:33,286 --> 00:29:34,746
Well, this is what we look like.

256
00:29:34,826 --> 00:29:37,376
Some of us. Others look different.

257
00:29:37,456 --> 00:29:38,916
BB-8 says he's on a secret mission.

258
00:29:38,996 --> 00:29:40,506
He has to get back to your base.

259
00:29:40,626 --> 00:29:42,876
Apparently, he has a map that
leads to Luke Skywalker...

260
00:29:42,966 --> 00:29:44,626
and everyone's after it.

261
00:29:45,256 --> 00:29:46,966
Luke Skywalker?

262
00:29:47,506 --> 00:29:49,006
I thought he was a myth.

263
00:29:49,216 --> 00:29:51,306
What?

264
00:29:59,316 --> 00:30:00,856
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

265
00:30:02,146 --> 00:30:03,316
Come on, BB-8!

266
00:30:06,656 --> 00:30:08,156
- Let go of me!
- Come on, we gotta move!

267
00:30:08,276 --> 00:30:10,366
I know how to run
without you holding my hand!

268
00:30:12,946 --> 00:30:14,746
BB-8, stay close!

269
00:30:14,826 --> 00:30:15,826
This way.

270
00:30:21,626 --> 00:30:22,836
<i>Call in the air strike.</i>

271
00:30:23,666 --> 00:30:25,216
Come on!

272
00:30:26,676 --> 00:30:27,886
They're shooting at both of us.

273
00:30:28,006 --> 00:30:29,886
Yeah. They saw you with me.
You're marked.

274
00:30:30,006 --> 00:30:31,426
- Well, thanks for that.
- Hey!

275
00:30:31,506 --> 00:30:33,346
I'm not the one who chased
you down with a stick.

276
00:30:34,636 --> 00:30:36,136
Does anyone have
blasters around here?

277
00:30:36,226 --> 00:30:37,766
Are you okay?

278
00:30:43,316 --> 00:30:44,736
Stop taking my hand!

279
00:31:01,036 --> 00:31:02,046
Hey.

280
00:31:05,336 --> 00:31:06,376
Are you okay?

281
00:31:08,386 --> 00:31:09,386
Yeah.

282
00:31:10,046 --> 00:31:11,176
Follow me.

283
00:31:22,726 --> 00:31:23,976
- We can't outrun them!
- We might...

284
00:31:24,066 --> 00:31:25,356
in that quadjumper!

285
00:31:25,436 --> 00:31:26,776
Hey, we need a pilot!

286
00:31:26,896 --> 00:31:28,446
We've got one.

287
00:31:28,566 --> 00:31:29,566
You?

288
00:31:30,236 --> 00:31:32,196
Uh, what about that ship?

289
00:31:32,276 --> 00:31:33,736
That one's garbage!

290
00:31:39,246 --> 00:31:40,706
The garbage will do.

291
00:31:56,596 --> 00:31:58,306
Gunner position is down there!

292
00:32:01,556 --> 00:32:03,186
You ever fly this thing?

293
00:32:03,306 --> 00:32:06,436
No! This ship hasn't flown in years.

294
00:32:06,606 --> 00:32:07,606
Great.

295
00:32:11,816 --> 00:32:13,026
Whoa.

296
00:32:13,656 --> 00:32:15,236
I can do this. I can do this.

297
00:32:15,656 --> 00:32:17,286
I can do this. I can do this.

298
00:32:38,476 --> 00:32:39,476
Hey!

299
00:32:43,806 --> 00:32:45,356
That's mine!

300
00:32:48,936 --> 00:32:50,526
Wait, stay low! Hey, stay low!

301
00:32:50,646 --> 00:32:51,736
- What?
<i>- Stay low!</i>

302
00:32:51,816 --> 00:32:53,026
It confuses their tracking.

303
00:32:53,406 --> 00:32:55,326
BB-8, hold on!

304
00:32:55,486 --> 00:32:56,866
I'm going low!

305
00:33:15,506 --> 00:33:16,716
What are you doing back there?

306
00:33:16,846 --> 00:33:18,006
Are you ever gonna fire back?

307
00:33:18,176 --> 00:33:20,226
I'm working on it! Are the shields up?

308
00:33:20,346 --> 00:33:22,016
Not so easy without a co-pilot!

309
00:33:22,186 --> 00:33:24,056
Try sitting in this thing.

310
00:33:38,366 --> 00:33:39,696
We need cover, quick!

311
00:33:39,866 --> 00:33:41,156
We're about to get some!

312
00:33:41,246 --> 00:33:42,456
I hope.

313
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:09,646
Damn it!

314
00:34:20,616 --> 00:34:22,406
Come on, come on!

315
00:34:25,246 --> 00:34:27,496
- Nice shot!
- I'm getting pretty good at this.

316
00:34:41,506 --> 00:34:43,136
Uh, the cannon's stuck
in forward position.

317
00:34:43,216 --> 00:34:44,886
I can't move it. You gotta lose him!

318
00:34:48,766 --> 00:34:51,266
- Get ready!
- Okay. For what?

319
00:35:05,076 --> 00:35:06,206
Are we really doing this?

320
00:35:15,626 --> 00:35:16,966
Oh, no.

321
00:35:38,396 --> 00:35:39,406
Whoo!

322
00:35:53,796 --> 00:35:55,296
- Nice shooting.
- Now that was some flying.

323
00:35:55,376 --> 00:35:56,376
- Thanks.
- How did you do that?

324
00:35:56,456 --> 00:35:57,756
- I don't know.
- No one trained you?

325
00:35:57,836 --> 00:35:59,586
I've flown some ships, but
I've never left the planet.

326
00:35:59,676 --> 00:36:00,836
- Your last shot was dead-on.
- That was amazing.

327
00:36:00,926 --> 00:36:02,256
- You got him with one blast!
- You set me up for it.

328
00:36:02,346 --> 00:36:03,716
- It was perfect.
- That was pretty good.

329
00:36:07,346 --> 00:36:09,346
You're okay. He's with the Resistance.

330
00:36:10,726 --> 00:36:12,356
He's gonna get you home.

331
00:36:13,476 --> 00:36:14,476
We both will.

332
00:36:20,316 --> 00:36:21,446
I don't know your name.

333
00:36:23,406 --> 00:36:24,946
Finn. What's yours?

334
00:36:26,236 --> 00:36:27,536
I'm Rey.

335
00:36:32,076 --> 00:36:33,416
Rey...

336
00:36:34,036 --> 00:36:36,336
Help me with this. Quick!

337
00:36:36,416 --> 00:36:37,796
Whoa, what's going on?

338
00:36:49,056 --> 00:36:50,226
Sir...

339
00:36:50,306 --> 00:36:52,936
we were unable to acquire
the droid on Jakku.

340
00:36:55,396 --> 00:36:56,566
It escaped capture...

341
00:36:56,646 --> 00:36:59,236
aboard a stolen
Corellian YT model freighter.

342
00:37:00,776 --> 00:37:02,856
<i>The droid...</i>

343
00:37:02,946 --> 00:37:04,566
<i>stole a freighter?</i>

344
00:37:04,696 --> 00:37:06,076
Not exactly, sir.

345
00:37:06,736 --> 00:37:07,736
It had help.

346
00:37:11,366 --> 00:37:12,456
We have no confirmation...

347
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,956
but we believe FN-2187 may
have helped in the escape.

348
00:37:33,306 --> 00:37:34,306
<i>Anything else?</i>

349
00:37:37,186 --> 00:37:38,606
The two were accompanied by a girl.

350
00:37:44,026 --> 00:37:45,776
<i>What girl?</i>

351
00:37:48,486 --> 00:37:49,576
It's the motivator.

352
00:37:49,656 --> 00:37:51,156
Grab me a Harris wrench,
check in there.

353
00:37:51,246 --> 00:37:52,246
How bad is it?

354
00:37:52,326 --> 00:37:53,996
If we wanna live, not good.

355
00:37:54,116 --> 00:37:55,076
They're hunting for us now.

356
00:37:55,166 --> 00:37:56,326
We've gotta get out of this system!

357
00:37:56,456 --> 00:37:57,956
BB-8 said the location
of the Resistance base...

358
00:37:58,126 --> 00:37:59,166
is "need to know".

359
00:37:59,296 --> 00:38:00,916
If I'm taking you there, I need to know!

360
00:38:01,006 --> 00:38:02,006
This?

361
00:38:03,256 --> 00:38:04,876
You gotta tell us
where your base is.

362
00:38:05,006 --> 00:38:07,596
I don't speak that.

363
00:38:07,676 --> 00:38:09,426
All right, between us...

364
00:38:09,506 --> 00:38:10,966
I'm not with the Resistance, okay?

365
00:38:11,966 --> 00:38:13,556
I'm just trying to get away
from the First Order.

366
00:38:13,636 --> 00:38:15,386
But you tell us where the base is...

367
00:38:15,476 --> 00:38:16,896
I'll get you there first. Deal?

368
00:38:17,976 --> 00:38:20,476
- Droid, please!
- Pilex driver, hurry.

369
00:38:20,606 --> 00:38:23,236
- So, where's your base?
- Go on, BB-8, tell her.

370
00:38:26,446 --> 00:38:27,446
Please.

371
00:38:29,486 --> 00:38:31,366
- The Ileenium system?
- Yeah, the Ileenium system.

372
00:38:31,486 --> 00:38:33,116
That's the one. Get us there
as fast as you can.

373
00:38:33,496 --> 00:38:34,826
I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal.

374
00:38:34,996 --> 00:38:36,076
I need the bonding tape, hurry!

375
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:37,246
What about you?

376
00:38:37,326 --> 00:38:38,536
I gotta get back to Jakku.

377
00:38:38,666 --> 00:38:39,626
Back to Jak...

378
00:38:39,706 --> 00:38:41,166
Why does everyone
wanna go back to Jakku?

379
00:38:41,246 --> 00:38:43,836
- It's not that one. No. No.
- That place is...

380
00:38:43,966 --> 00:38:45,836
The one I'm pointing to. No.

381
00:38:45,926 --> 00:38:47,216
No. No!

382
00:38:47,336 --> 00:38:48,676
If we don't patch it up...

383
00:38:48,846 --> 00:38:49,886
the propulsion tank will overflow...

384
00:38:49,966 --> 00:38:51,636
and flood the ship with poisonous gas!

385
00:38:51,716 --> 00:38:52,716
- This?
- Yes.

386
00:38:54,096 --> 00:38:56,936
Hey, Rey, you're a pilot.

387
00:38:57,016 --> 00:38:58,936
You can fly anywhere. Why go back?

388
00:38:59,016 --> 00:39:00,306
You got a family?

389
00:39:00,396 --> 00:39:01,516
You got a boyfriend? A cute boyfriend?

390
00:39:01,646 --> 00:39:03,106
None of your business, that's why.

391
00:39:05,526 --> 00:39:06,896
- That can't be good.
- No, it can't be.

392
00:39:12,866 --> 00:39:13,866
Someone's locked on to us.

393
00:39:13,996 --> 00:39:15,536
All controls are overridden.

394
00:39:22,336 --> 00:39:24,046
Get off! Get off!

395
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:26,796
See anything?

396
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,256
Oh, no.

397
00:39:37,516 --> 00:39:38,516
It's the First Order.

398
00:39:38,596 --> 00:39:40,396
What do we do?
There must be something.

399
00:39:41,186 --> 00:39:42,856
- You said poisonous gas.
- I fixed that.

400
00:39:42,936 --> 00:39:43,936
Can you unfix it?

401
00:39:49,736 --> 00:39:50,736
Come on, BB-8.

402
00:39:51,486 --> 00:39:53,366
I got him.

403
00:39:54,696 --> 00:39:56,446
I'm okay.

404
00:39:57,286 --> 00:39:58,826
BB-8, get off me!

405
00:40:01,706 --> 00:40:03,376
Do you think this will work
on the stormtroopers?

406
00:40:03,456 --> 00:40:06,006
Yeah. Their masks filter out
smoke, not toxins.

407
00:40:13,386 --> 00:40:14,556
- Hurry.
- I'm hurrying.

408
00:40:26,646 --> 00:40:29,066
Chewie...

409
00:40:29,146 --> 00:40:30,396
we're home.

410
00:40:46,416 --> 00:40:47,586
Where are the others?

411
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:49,256
- Where's the pilot?
<i>- I'm the pilot.</i>

412
00:40:49,336 --> 00:40:50,796
You?

413
00:40:50,876 --> 00:40:52,836
<i>No, it's true.
We're the only ones on board.</i>

414
00:40:52,926 --> 00:40:54,346
<i>You can understand that thing?</i>

415
00:40:54,466 --> 00:40:55,596
And "that thing"
can understand you, too...

416
00:40:55,676 --> 00:40:56,716
so watch it.

417
00:40:56,806 --> 00:40:58,716
Come on out of there.

418
00:40:59,426 --> 00:41:01,306
- Where'd you get this ship?
- Niima Outpost.

419
00:41:01,436 --> 00:41:03,976
Jakku? That junkyard?

420
00:41:04,056 --> 00:41:05,266
Thank you! Junkyard.

421
00:41:05,356 --> 00:41:07,436
Told you we should have
double-checked the Western Reaches.

422
00:41:07,526 --> 00:41:09,276
Who had it? Ducain?

423
00:41:09,356 --> 00:41:11,196
I stole it. From Unkar Plutt.

424
00:41:11,276 --> 00:41:13,486
He stole it from the Irving Boys,
who stole it from Ducain.

425
00:41:13,606 --> 00:41:15,906
Who stole it from me!

426
00:41:15,986 --> 00:41:17,406
Well, you tell him that Han Solo...

427
00:41:17,486 --> 00:41:19,866
just stole back the
<i>Millennium Falcon</i> for good.

428
00:41:19,996 --> 00:41:22,866
This is the <i>Millennium Falcon?</i>
You're Han Solo?

429
00:41:24,496 --> 00:41:26,036
I used to be.

430
00:41:26,706 --> 00:41:28,166
Han Solo, the Rebellion general?

431
00:41:28,246 --> 00:41:29,626
No, the smuggler.

432
00:41:29,706 --> 00:41:31,546
Wasn't he a war hero?

433
00:41:31,626 --> 00:41:34,966
This is the ship that made
the Kessel Run in 14 parsecs?

434
00:41:35,046 --> 00:41:36,296
Twelve!

435
00:41:37,386 --> 00:41:38,846
Fourteen.

436
00:41:54,196 --> 00:41:55,356
Hey!

437
00:41:55,866 --> 00:41:58,866
Some moof-milker
put a compressor on the ignition line.

438
00:41:58,946 --> 00:42:00,036
Unkar Plutt did.

439
00:42:00,116 --> 00:42:01,496
I thought it was a mistake,
too. Puts too much...

440
00:42:01,576 --> 00:42:03,866
...stress on the hyperdrive.

441
00:42:04,916 --> 00:42:06,376
Chewie, throw them in a pod.

442
00:42:06,496 --> 00:42:08,376
We'll drop them at the
nearest inhabited planet.

443
00:42:08,456 --> 00:42:10,166
Wait, no.

444
00:42:10,246 --> 00:42:12,666
- We need your help.
- My help?

445
00:42:12,756 --> 00:42:14,296
This droid has to get
to the Resistance base...

446
00:42:14,376 --> 00:42:15,676
as soon as possible.

447
00:42:16,386 --> 00:42:18,756
He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker.

448
00:42:23,266 --> 00:42:26,186
You are the Han Solo that
fought with the Rebellion.

449
00:42:32,276 --> 00:42:33,276
You knew him.

450
00:42:36,606 --> 00:42:39,736
Yeah. I knew him.

451
00:42:39,826 --> 00:42:41,446
I knew Luke.

452
00:42:44,246 --> 00:42:46,536
Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten loose.

453
00:42:47,206 --> 00:42:48,206
Wait, what?

454
00:42:49,126 --> 00:42:50,796
Did you just say Rathtars?

455
00:42:51,546 --> 00:42:52,546
Hey!

456
00:42:52,626 --> 00:42:55,166
You're not hauling Rathtars
on this freighter, are you?

457
00:42:55,716 --> 00:42:57,926
I'm hauling Rathtars.

458
00:42:58,006 --> 00:43:01,216
Oh, great. It's the Guavian Death Gang.

459
00:43:01,306 --> 00:43:02,766
Must have tracked us from Nantoon.

460
00:43:02,886 --> 00:43:04,676
What's a Rathtar?

461
00:43:04,766 --> 00:43:06,266
They're big and they're dangerous.

462
00:43:06,346 --> 00:43:07,896
You ever heard of the Trillia Massacre?

463
00:43:07,976 --> 00:43:09,016
- No.
- Good.

464
00:43:09,106 --> 00:43:10,976
I got three of them going to King Prana.

465
00:43:11,066 --> 00:43:13,396
Three? How'd you get them on board?

466
00:43:13,476 --> 00:43:15,186
I used to have a bigger crew.

467
00:43:18,776 --> 00:43:20,696
Get below and stay there
until I say so...

468
00:43:20,776 --> 00:43:22,366
and don't even think about
taking the <i>Falcon.</i>

469
00:43:22,446 --> 00:43:23,446
What about BB-8?

470
00:43:23,536 --> 00:43:25,246
He stays with me
until I get rid of the gang...

471
00:43:25,326 --> 00:43:26,866
then you can have him back
and be on your way.

472
00:43:26,956 --> 00:43:28,916
What about the Rathtars?
Where are you keeping them?

473
00:43:31,336 --> 00:43:33,376
- There's one.
- What are you gonna do?

474
00:43:33,456 --> 00:43:35,756
Same thing I always do.
Talk my way out of it.

475
00:43:37,086 --> 00:43:39,336
Yes, I do. Every time.

476
00:43:56,606 --> 00:43:58,606
Han Solo.

477
00:43:58,696 --> 00:44:00,156
You're a dead man.

478
00:44:00,276 --> 00:44:02,986
Bala-Tik. What's the problem?

479
00:44:03,196 --> 00:44:05,866
The problem is we loaned you
50,000 for this job.

480
00:44:06,036 --> 00:44:08,496
- Can you see them?
- No.

481
00:44:08,656 --> 00:44:11,666
I heard you also borrowed
50,000 from Kanjiklub.

482
00:44:11,876 --> 00:44:13,996
You know you can't trust
those little freaks.

483
00:44:14,666 --> 00:44:17,086
How long we known each other?

484
00:44:17,166 --> 00:44:18,256
They have blasters.

485
00:44:18,336 --> 00:44:19,426
A lot of them.

486
00:44:19,506 --> 00:44:22,716
Not long.
We want our money back now.

487
00:44:22,796 --> 00:44:24,806
You think hunting
Rathtars is cheap?

488
00:44:24,886 --> 00:44:26,056
I spent that money.

489
00:44:26,136 --> 00:44:28,556
Kanjiklub wants
their investment back, too.

490
00:44:28,676 --> 00:44:30,976
I never made a deal with Kanjiklub!

491
00:44:31,056 --> 00:44:32,936
Tell that to Kanjiklub.

492
00:44:42,236 --> 00:44:44,446
Tasu Leech.

493
00:44:44,526 --> 00:44:45,526
Good to see you.

494
00:44:54,376 --> 00:44:57,376
Boys, you're both gonna
get what I promised.

495
00:44:57,456 --> 00:44:58,836
Have I ever not delivered...

496
00:44:58,916 --> 00:45:00,416
- for you before?
- Yeah.

497
00:45:04,716 --> 00:45:07,716
- What was the second time?
- Your game is old.

498
00:45:07,846 --> 00:45:10,346
There's no one in the galaxy
left for you to swindle.

499
00:45:13,016 --> 00:45:14,016
That BB unit.

500
00:45:14,096 --> 00:45:16,936
The First Order is looking
for one just like it.

501
00:45:20,436 --> 00:45:21,736
And two fugitives.

502
00:45:25,616 --> 00:45:26,736
First I've heard of it.

503
00:45:32,576 --> 00:45:33,746
Wait, wait, wait.

504
00:45:36,916 --> 00:45:38,956
If we close the blast doors
in that corridor...

505
00:45:39,086 --> 00:45:40,206
we can trap both gangs!

506
00:45:40,296 --> 00:45:41,756
We'll close the blast doors from here?

507
00:45:41,836 --> 00:45:43,626
Resetting the fuses should do it.

508
00:45:51,596 --> 00:45:53,386
I got a bad feeling about this.

509
00:45:53,476 --> 00:45:55,596
- Oh, no.
- "Oh, no," what?

510
00:45:56,556 --> 00:45:57,566
Wrong fuses.

511
00:45:57,646 --> 00:45:58,816
Kill them!

512
00:45:58,936 --> 00:46:00,146
- Whoa...
- And take the droid!

513
00:46:25,966 --> 00:46:27,796
- This was a mistake!
- Huge!

514
00:46:41,026 --> 00:46:42,026
What do they look like?

515
00:46:47,986 --> 00:46:49,986
They look like that.

516
00:46:52,236 --> 00:46:54,076
- This way.
- Are you sure?

517
00:46:55,996 --> 00:46:57,166
No, no, no!

518
00:46:58,206 --> 00:46:59,586
Finn!

519
00:47:00,586 --> 00:47:01,666
Finn!

520
00:47:02,836 --> 00:47:03,836
Rey!

521
00:47:07,006 --> 00:47:08,296
Get off! Get off!

522
00:47:13,716 --> 00:47:16,056
- Rey!
- Finn!

523
00:47:17,266 --> 00:47:18,346
Finn!

524
00:47:19,016 --> 00:47:20,686
<i>Get off me!</i>

525
00:47:32,366 --> 00:47:33,866
<i>Rey!</i>

526
00:47:36,906 --> 00:47:39,786
Get off! Get off!

527
00:47:42,206 --> 00:47:43,706
Finn!

528
00:47:44,376 --> 00:47:46,716
- It had me! But the door...
- That was lucky.

529
00:47:50,756 --> 00:47:53,056
I got the door. Cover us!

530
00:47:59,896 --> 00:48:01,766
Chewie!

531
00:48:04,646 --> 00:48:06,236
You okay?

532
00:48:07,396 --> 00:48:08,396
Wow.

533
00:48:10,606 --> 00:48:12,826
Come on! Come on!

534
00:48:16,576 --> 00:48:17,576
Han.

535
00:48:17,656 --> 00:48:19,916
You, close the door behind us.
You, take care of Chewie!

536
00:48:27,586 --> 00:48:28,836
Hey, where are you going?

537
00:48:28,916 --> 00:48:30,586
Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump, too.

538
00:48:30,676 --> 00:48:32,466
If we don't prime that,
we're not going anywhere.

539
00:48:32,586 --> 00:48:33,756
I hate that guy.

540
00:48:33,886 --> 00:48:36,386
- And you could use a co-pilot.
- I got one, he's back there.

541
00:48:38,846 --> 00:48:40,806
Watch the thrust. We're going
out of here at lightspeed.

542
00:48:40,936 --> 00:48:42,726
From inside the hangar?
Is that even possible?

543
00:48:42,806 --> 00:48:45,066
I never ask that question
till after I've done it.

544
00:48:47,316 --> 00:48:49,446
This is not how I thought
this day was gonna go.

545
00:48:49,566 --> 00:48:51,526
Angle the shield. Hang on back there.

546
00:48:51,606 --> 00:48:52,776
No problem!

547
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:03,956
Come on, baby, don't let me down.

548
00:49:06,496 --> 00:49:08,456
- What?
- Compressor.

549
00:49:16,966 --> 00:49:18,176
Inform the First Order...

550
00:49:18,266 --> 00:49:20,096
that Han Solo has the droid they want.

551
00:49:20,176 --> 00:49:22,186
And it's aboard the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>

552
00:49:31,106 --> 00:49:35,486
<i>The droid will soon be
delivered to the Resistance...</i>

553
00:49:36,696 --> 00:49:40,496
leading them to the last Jedi.

554
00:49:41,706 --> 00:49:45,456
If Skywalker returns...

555
00:49:45,996 --> 00:49:50,006
the new Jedi will rise.

556
00:49:51,166 --> 00:49:52,716
Supreme Leader,
I take full responsibility...

557
00:49:52,836 --> 00:49:54,506
General!

558
00:49:56,716 --> 00:49:59,516
Our strategy must now change.

559
00:49:59,636 --> 00:50:01,676
The weapon. It is ready.

560
00:50:01,806 --> 00:50:04,056
I believe the time has come to use it.

561
00:50:04,186 --> 00:50:05,476
We shall destroy the government...

562
00:50:05,556 --> 00:50:06,976
that supports the Resistance...

563
00:50:07,056 --> 00:50:08,766
the Republic.

564
00:50:08,856 --> 00:50:10,396
Without their friends to protect them...

565
00:50:10,476 --> 00:50:12,066
the Resistance will be vulnerable.

566
00:50:12,316 --> 00:50:15,236
And we will stop them
before they reach Skywalker.

567
00:50:15,316 --> 00:50:16,566
Go.

568
00:50:17,366 --> 00:50:18,776
Oversee preparations.

569
00:50:18,866 --> 00:50:20,536
Yes, Supreme Leader.

570
00:50:26,496 --> 00:50:27,876
There has been an awakening.

571
00:50:29,586 --> 00:50:31,336
Have you felt it?

572
00:50:32,876 --> 00:50:33,916
<i>Yes.</i>

573
00:50:35,296 --> 00:50:36,926
There's something more.

574
00:50:38,466 --> 00:50:42,636
The droid we seek is aboard
the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>

575
00:50:43,426 --> 00:50:46,306
In the hands of your father...

576
00:50:46,396 --> 00:50:50,226
Han Solo.

577
00:50:52,856 --> 00:50:55,236
<i>He means nothing to me.</i>

578
00:50:55,356 --> 00:51:00,156
Even you, master of the
Knights of Ren...

579
00:51:00,776 --> 00:51:04,246
have never faced such a test.

580
00:51:04,866 --> 00:51:08,076
<i>By the grace of your training,
I will not be seduced.</i>

581
00:51:09,206 --> 00:51:11,036
We shall see.

582
00:51:13,626 --> 00:51:15,466
We shall see.

583
00:51:23,556 --> 00:51:25,766
- Electrical overload.
- I can fix that.

584
00:51:25,886 --> 00:51:27,136
Coolant's leaking.

585
00:51:28,476 --> 00:51:29,726
Try transferring auxiliary power...

586
00:51:29,856 --> 00:51:31,226
...to the secondary tank.

587
00:51:31,316 --> 00:51:32,856
I got it.

588
00:51:33,026 --> 00:51:34,646
Chewie, come on!

589
00:51:36,276 --> 00:51:37,856
I need help with this giant hairy thing!

590
00:51:37,946 --> 00:51:38,946
Stop moving!

591
00:51:40,986 --> 00:51:42,776
Chewie!

592
00:51:42,906 --> 00:51:44,616
You hurt Chewie,
you're gonna deal with me!

593
00:51:44,746 --> 00:51:47,076
Hurt him? He almost killed me six times!

594
00:51:47,996 --> 00:51:49,456
Which is fine!

595
00:51:49,576 --> 00:51:51,036
This hyperdrive blows,
there are gonna be...

596
00:51:51,126 --> 00:51:53,086
pieces of us in three different systems.

597
00:51:56,466 --> 00:51:57,466
What'd you do?

598
00:51:58,506 --> 00:52:00,426
I bypassed the compressor.

599
00:52:02,756 --> 00:52:03,756
Huh.

600
00:52:07,016 --> 00:52:08,306
Move, ball.

601
00:52:10,476 --> 00:52:12,556
Ah, don't say that.

602
00:52:12,646 --> 00:52:14,316
You did great. Just rest.

603
00:52:15,226 --> 00:52:16,316
Good job, kid.

604
00:52:16,776 --> 00:52:17,776
Thanks.

605
00:52:18,316 --> 00:52:19,606
You're welcome.

606
00:52:24,366 --> 00:52:25,786
So...

607
00:52:25,906 --> 00:52:27,246
fugitives, huh?

608
00:52:29,156 --> 00:52:30,456
The First Order wants the map.

609
00:52:30,536 --> 00:52:31,826
Finn is with the Resistance.

610
00:52:32,456 --> 00:52:33,876
I'm just a scavenger.

611
00:52:35,916 --> 00:52:36,916
Let's see what you got.

612
00:52:37,796 --> 00:52:39,876
Go ahead.

613
00:52:49,016 --> 00:52:51,186
This map's not complete.

614
00:52:51,266 --> 00:52:52,766
It's just a piece.

615
00:52:53,976 --> 00:52:55,766
Ever since Luke disappeared...

616
00:52:55,896 --> 00:52:57,896
people have been looking for him.

617
00:52:57,986 --> 00:52:59,486
Why did he leave?

618
00:53:00,696 --> 00:53:03,446
He was training
a new generation of Jedi.

619
00:53:03,526 --> 00:53:05,196
One boy, an apprentice...

620
00:53:05,276 --> 00:53:07,576
turned against him, destroyed it all.

621
00:53:09,156 --> 00:53:11,076
Luke felt responsible.

622
00:53:11,156 --> 00:53:13,666
He just walked away from everything.

623
00:53:14,376 --> 00:53:15,836
Do you know what happened to him?

624
00:53:15,996 --> 00:53:18,376
A lot of rumors. Stories.

625
00:53:20,376 --> 00:53:22,586
People that knew him best...

626
00:53:24,086 --> 00:53:26,466
think he went looking
for the first Jedi temple.

627
00:53:28,216 --> 00:53:29,556
The Jedi were real?

628
00:53:29,636 --> 00:53:31,846
I used to wonder about that myself.

629
00:53:31,936 --> 00:53:34,146
Thought it was a bunch
of mumbo-jumbo.

630
00:53:35,016 --> 00:53:37,606
A magical power holding
together good and evil...

631
00:53:37,686 --> 00:53:39,816
the dark side and the light.

632
00:53:41,186 --> 00:53:43,356
Crazy thing is...

633
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:47,196
it's true.

634
00:53:49,746 --> 00:53:51,366
The Force. The Jedi.

635
00:53:53,956 --> 00:53:54,956
All of it.

636
00:53:58,206 --> 00:53:59,546
It's all true.

637
00:54:02,796 --> 00:54:04,926
No, you rest.

638
00:54:05,046 --> 00:54:07,796
You want my help? You're getting it.

639
00:54:07,886 --> 00:54:09,926
Gonna see an old friend.
She'll get your droid home.

640
00:54:11,216 --> 00:54:12,556
This is our stop.

641
00:54:29,946 --> 00:54:31,446
I didn't know there was
this much green...

642
00:54:31,536 --> 00:54:32,826
in the whole galaxy.

643
00:55:00,816 --> 00:55:02,856
Hey, Solo, I'm not sure what
we're walking into here...

644
00:55:02,976 --> 00:55:04,606
Did you just call me Solo?

645
00:55:04,686 --> 00:55:06,316
Sorry. Han. Mr. Solo.

646
00:55:06,396 --> 00:55:07,486
You should know...

647
00:55:07,566 --> 00:55:09,946
I'm a big deal in the Resistance.

648
00:55:10,026 --> 00:55:12,366
Which puts a real target on my back.

649
00:55:12,486 --> 00:55:14,076
Are there any conspirators here?

650
00:55:14,156 --> 00:55:16,036
Like, First Order sympathizers?

651
00:55:16,156 --> 00:55:18,826
Listen, Big Deal.

652
00:55:18,916 --> 00:55:20,836
You got another problem.

653
00:55:20,916 --> 00:55:23,086
Women always figure out the truth.

654
00:55:24,666 --> 00:55:26,006
Always.

655
00:55:32,006 --> 00:55:33,386
You might need this.

656
00:55:34,676 --> 00:55:36,346
I think I can handle myself.

657
00:55:36,476 --> 00:55:38,596
I know you do. That's why
I'm giving it to you.

658
00:55:38,686 --> 00:55:39,686
Take it.

659
00:55:42,516 --> 00:55:43,686
You know how to use one of those?

660
00:55:43,776 --> 00:55:45,436
Yeah. You pull the trigger.

661
00:55:45,526 --> 00:55:47,356
Little bit more to it than that.

662
00:55:47,856 --> 00:55:49,526
You got a lot to learn.

663
00:55:50,946 --> 00:55:52,196
You got a name?

664
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:54,116
Rey.

665
00:55:54,826 --> 00:55:55,826
Rey.

666
00:55:59,706 --> 00:56:02,126
I been thinking about bringing
on some more crew, Rey.

667
00:56:02,206 --> 00:56:04,166
A second mate. Someone to help out.

668
00:56:04,246 --> 00:56:05,876
Someone who can keep up
with Chewie and me...

669
00:56:05,956 --> 00:56:07,546
appreciates the <i>Falcon.</i>

670
00:56:07,666 --> 00:56:09,466
Are you offering me a job?

671
00:56:09,546 --> 00:56:12,046
I wouldn't be nice to you.
Doesn't pay much.

672
00:56:12,176 --> 00:56:14,006
You're offering me a job.

673
00:56:15,216 --> 00:56:16,726
I'm thinking about it.

674
00:56:20,396 --> 00:56:21,556
Well?

675
00:56:26,066 --> 00:56:28,736
If you were, I'd be flattered.
But I have to get home.

676
00:56:29,646 --> 00:56:31,156
Where, Jakku?

677
00:56:31,736 --> 00:56:33,526
I've already been away too long.

678
00:56:35,236 --> 00:56:37,616
Chewie, check out the ship
as best you can.

679
00:56:41,326 --> 00:56:44,246
That's too bad. Chewie kind of likes you.

680
00:56:47,336 --> 00:56:49,006
Solo, why are we here again?

681
00:56:49,126 --> 00:56:50,626
To get your droid on a clean ship.

682
00:56:50,756 --> 00:56:51,716
Clean?

683
00:56:51,796 --> 00:56:54,676
You think it was luck
that Chewie and I found the <i>Falcon?</i>

684
00:56:55,346 --> 00:56:56,886
If we can find it on our scanners...

685
00:56:56,966 --> 00:56:59,306
the First Order's not far behind.

686
00:56:59,426 --> 00:57:02,226
Wanna get BB-8 to the Resistance?

687
00:57:02,306 --> 00:57:04,146
Maz Kanata's our best bet.

688
00:57:05,016 --> 00:57:06,516
We can trust her, right?

689
00:57:06,606 --> 00:57:08,146
Relax, kid.

690
00:57:08,276 --> 00:57:10,946
She's run this watering hole
for a thousand years.

691
00:57:11,696 --> 00:57:13,736
Maz is a bit of an acquired taste...

692
00:57:13,816 --> 00:57:15,196
so let me do the talking.

693
00:57:15,276 --> 00:57:17,036
And whatever you do, don't stare.

694
00:57:17,116 --> 00:57:18,156
At what?

695
00:57:19,196 --> 00:57:20,286
Any of it.

696
00:57:41,476 --> 00:57:43,476
Han Solo!

697
00:57:47,646 --> 00:57:48,896
Oh, boy.

698
00:57:49,026 --> 00:57:50,186
Hey, Maz.

699
00:57:54,026 --> 00:57:55,986
Where's my boyfriend?

700
00:57:56,486 --> 00:57:58,116
Chewie's working on the <i>Falcon.</i>

701
00:57:58,196 --> 00:57:59,196
I like that Wookiee.

702
00:57:59,996 --> 00:58:01,956
I assume you need something.

703
00:58:02,036 --> 00:58:03,456
Desperately.

704
00:58:03,536 --> 00:58:04,536
Let's get to it.

705
00:58:59,096 --> 00:59:00,556
<i>Forgive me.</i>

706
00:59:03,216 --> 00:59:04,886
<i>I feel it again.</i>

707
00:59:08,556 --> 00:59:10,106
<i>The pull to the light.</i>

708
00:59:12,936 --> 00:59:15,446
<i>Supreme Leader senses it.</i>

709
00:59:16,526 --> 00:59:17,906
<i>Show me again.</i>

710
00:59:18,406 --> 00:59:20,576
<i>The power of the darkness.</i>

711
00:59:21,866 --> 00:59:24,446
<i>And I will let nothing stand in our way.</i>

712
00:59:25,406 --> 00:59:26,786
<i>Show me...</i>

713
00:59:28,956 --> 00:59:30,286
<i>Grandfather...</i>

714
00:59:32,746 --> 00:59:35,086
<i>and I will finish...</i>

715
00:59:35,216 --> 00:59:36,586
<i>what you started.</i>

716
00:59:49,396 --> 00:59:50,806
A map.

717
00:59:51,436 --> 00:59:53,566
To Skywalker himself?

718
00:59:53,646 --> 00:59:56,396
You are right back
in the mess.

719
00:59:56,486 --> 00:59:59,946
Maz, I need you to get this droid to Leia.

720
01:00:00,776 --> 01:00:01,776
Hmm...

721
01:00:01,906 --> 01:00:02,906
No.

722
01:00:04,286 --> 01:00:08,286
You've been running away
from this fight for too long.

723
01:00:08,786 --> 01:00:09,746
Han.

724
01:00:12,456 --> 01:00:13,956
Go home.

725
01:00:14,626 --> 01:00:15,916
Leia doesn't wanna see me.

726
01:00:16,006 --> 01:00:18,216
Please, we came here for your help.

727
01:00:19,466 --> 01:00:20,466
What fight?

728
01:00:21,676 --> 01:00:23,716
The only fight.

729
01:00:23,806 --> 01:00:25,966
Against the dark side.

730
01:00:26,056 --> 01:00:27,386
Through the ages...

731
01:00:27,476 --> 01:00:29,596
I've seen evil take many forms.

732
01:00:30,686 --> 01:00:32,896
The Sith. The Empire.

733
01:00:32,976 --> 01:00:36,316
Today, it is the First Order.

734
01:00:37,106 --> 01:00:40,026
Their shadow is spreading
across the galaxy.

735
01:00:40,156 --> 01:00:41,526
We must face them.

736
01:00:41,656 --> 01:00:43,696
Fight them.

737
01:00:43,826 --> 01:00:45,366
All of us.

738
01:00:45,986 --> 01:00:47,576
There is no fight against the First Order.

739
01:00:47,656 --> 01:00:48,786
Not one we can win.

740
01:00:49,996 --> 01:00:51,246
Look around.

741
01:00:51,326 --> 01:00:53,706
There's no chance we haven't
been recognized already.

742
01:00:53,836 --> 01:00:56,046
I bet you the First Order
is on their way right...

743
01:00:57,336 --> 01:00:58,336
What's this?

744
01:01:00,176 --> 01:01:01,176
What are you doing?

745
01:01:05,886 --> 01:01:07,386
Solo, what is she doing?

746
01:01:07,516 --> 01:01:09,266
I don't know. But it ain't good.

747
01:01:09,426 --> 01:01:11,226
If you live long enough...

748
01:01:11,306 --> 01:01:14,806
you see the same eyes
in different people.

749
01:01:15,726 --> 01:01:20,196
I'm looking at the eyes
of a man who wants to run.

750
01:01:23,066 --> 01:01:25,026
You don't know a thing about me.

751
01:01:26,366 --> 01:01:29,366
Where I'm from. What I've seen.

752
01:01:30,036 --> 01:01:32,706
You don't know the First Order like I do.

753
01:01:33,666 --> 01:01:35,836
They'll slaughter us.

754
01:01:35,916 --> 01:01:38,046
We all need to run.

755
01:01:39,166 --> 01:01:40,216
Hmm.

756
01:01:46,506 --> 01:01:47,506
You see those two?

757
01:01:48,216 --> 01:01:49,846
They'll trade work for transportation...

758
01:01:49,966 --> 01:01:51,386
to the Outer Rim.

759
01:01:51,476 --> 01:01:53,686
There, you can disappear.

760
01:01:53,896 --> 01:01:54,896
Finn?

761
01:01:57,316 --> 01:01:58,316
Come with me.

762
01:01:59,356 --> 01:02:01,396
What about BB-8? We're not done yet.

763
01:02:01,486 --> 01:02:03,146
We have to get him back to your base.

764
01:02:08,236 --> 01:02:09,576
I can't.

765
01:02:18,376 --> 01:02:19,586
Keep it, kid.

766
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:31,266
Who's the girl?

767
01:02:36,226 --> 01:02:38,186
I was told you can get me
to the Outer Rim.

768
01:02:38,266 --> 01:02:39,356
What are you doing?

769
01:02:41,106 --> 01:02:42,106
Don't leave without me.

770
01:02:45,946 --> 01:02:47,776
You can't just go. I won't let you.

771
01:02:47,866 --> 01:02:48,946
I'm not who you think I am.

772
01:02:49,026 --> 01:02:50,116
Finn, what are you talking about?

773
01:02:50,196 --> 01:02:51,236
I'm not Resistance.

774
01:02:51,946 --> 01:02:53,446
I'm not a hero.

775
01:02:56,706 --> 01:02:58,456
I'm a stormtrooper.

776
01:02:59,626 --> 01:03:02,546
Like all of them, I was taken
from a family I'll never know.

777
01:03:03,296 --> 01:03:05,296
And raised to do one thing.

778
01:03:06,006 --> 01:03:09,136
But my first battle, I made a choice.

779
01:03:10,306 --> 01:03:12,136
I wasn't gonna kill for them.

780
01:03:12,806 --> 01:03:15,726
So I ran. Right into you.

781
01:03:17,306 --> 01:03:19,396
And you looked at me
like no one ever had.

782
01:03:22,316 --> 01:03:24,606
I was ashamed of what I was.

783
01:03:27,156 --> 01:03:29,156
But I'm done with the First Order.

784
01:03:29,276 --> 01:03:31,076
I'm never going back.

785
01:03:33,156 --> 01:03:34,906
Rey, come with me.

786
01:03:35,996 --> 01:03:37,246
Don't go.

787
01:03:42,416 --> 01:03:44,166
Take care of yourself.

788
01:03:45,966 --> 01:03:47,626
Please.

789
01:04:01,356 --> 01:04:03,436
<i>No!</i>

790
01:04:03,516 --> 01:04:05,686
<i>No!</i>

791
01:04:18,996 --> 01:04:21,876
<i>No! Come back!</i>

792
01:04:22,876 --> 01:04:24,666
<i>No!</i>

793
01:04:40,726 --> 01:04:42,556
<i>Come back!</i>

794
01:04:52,906 --> 01:04:54,736
<i>No!</i>

795
01:05:45,706 --> 01:05:47,546
<i>No!</i>

796
01:05:47,626 --> 01:05:49,166
<i>Its energy...</i>

797
01:05:52,966 --> 01:05:55,006
- ...<i>surrounds us...</i>
<i>- No!</i>

798
01:05:55,136 --> 01:05:57,466
...<i>and binds us...</i>

799
01:06:05,306 --> 01:06:06,436
<i>The Force will be...</i>

800
01:06:15,486 --> 01:06:16,986
<i>No!</i>

801
01:06:17,116 --> 01:06:18,986
Come back!

802
01:06:19,116 --> 01:06:20,616
<i>Quiet, girl.</i>

803
01:06:21,496 --> 01:06:22,496
No!

804
01:06:27,076 --> 01:06:28,086
<i>Rey?</i>

805
01:06:32,666 --> 01:06:35,376
<i>These are your first steps.</i>

806
01:06:40,346 --> 01:06:41,346
What was that?

807
01:06:43,596 --> 01:06:45,306
I shouldn't have gone in there.

808
01:06:47,556 --> 01:06:50,016
That lightsaber was Luke's.

809
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:51,896
And his father's before him.

810
01:06:52,026 --> 01:06:55,656
And now, it calls to you.

811
01:06:55,776 --> 01:06:57,196
I have to get back to Jakku.

812
01:06:57,866 --> 01:06:59,526
Han told me.

813
01:07:07,286 --> 01:07:09,336
Dear child.

814
01:07:09,416 --> 01:07:11,456
I see your eyes.

815
01:07:11,546 --> 01:07:14,546
You already know the truth.

816
01:07:14,626 --> 01:07:17,086
Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku...

817
01:07:18,386 --> 01:07:20,386
they're never coming back.

818
01:07:26,436 --> 01:07:27,556
But...

819
01:07:27,646 --> 01:07:30,056
there's someone who still could.

820
01:07:32,776 --> 01:07:34,356
Luke.

821
01:07:34,436 --> 01:07:38,106
The belonging you seek
is not behind you...

822
01:07:38,236 --> 01:07:39,906
it is ahead.

823
01:07:40,026 --> 01:07:43,576
I am no Jedi, but I know the Force.

824
01:07:43,696 --> 01:07:47,786
It moves through and surrounds
every living thing.

825
01:07:49,706 --> 01:07:51,286
Close your eyes.

826
01:07:53,586 --> 01:07:54,586
Feel it.

827
01:07:55,876 --> 01:07:57,966
The light...

828
01:07:58,086 --> 01:08:00,466
it's always been there.

829
01:08:00,596 --> 01:08:02,596
It will guide you.

830
01:08:04,716 --> 01:08:06,766
The saber. Take it.

831
01:08:10,766 --> 01:08:12,726
I'm never touching that thing again.

832
01:08:12,816 --> 01:08:14,316
I don't want any part of this.

833
01:08:17,776 --> 01:08:18,776
Hmm.

834
01:08:40,796 --> 01:08:44,306
<i>Today is the end
of the Republic.</i>

835
01:08:46,306 --> 01:08:51,806
<i>The end of a regime
that acquiesces to disorder.</i>

836
01:08:53,106 --> 01:08:57,186
<i>At this very moment,
in a system far from here...</i>

837
01:08:57,316 --> 01:09:02,156
<i>the New Republic lies to the galaxy...</i>

838
01:09:02,276 --> 01:09:05,866
<i>while secretly supporting
the treachery...</i>

839
01:09:06,656 --> 01:09:09,996
<i>of the loathsome Resistance.</i>

840
01:09:10,076 --> 01:09:13,576
<i>This fierce machine
which you have built...</i>

841
01:09:13,666 --> 01:09:15,496
<i>upon which we stand...</i>

842
01:09:15,626 --> 01:09:18,006
<i>will bring an end to the Senate!</i>

843
01:09:18,086 --> 01:09:20,926
<i>To their cherished fleet!</i>

844
01:09:21,006 --> 01:09:25,466
<i>All remaining systems
will bow to the First Order!</i>

845
01:09:25,546 --> 01:09:28,056
<i>And will remember this...</i>

846
01:09:28,176 --> 01:09:33,226
<i>as the last day of the Republic!</i>

847
01:09:35,016 --> 01:09:37,146
Confirm transfer to manual control.

848
01:09:37,226 --> 01:09:38,776
Configure!

849
01:09:38,896 --> 01:09:40,356
<i>Fire!</i>

850
01:10:40,416 --> 01:10:43,086
No. What is it?

851
01:10:59,106 --> 01:11:00,266
It was the Republic.

852
01:11:01,436 --> 01:11:03,066
The First Order, they've done it.

853
01:11:05,446 --> 01:11:06,606
Where's Rey?

854
01:11:23,876 --> 01:11:26,126
What are you doing?

855
01:11:27,126 --> 01:11:29,346
You have to go back.

856
01:11:29,426 --> 01:11:30,546
I'm leaving.

857
01:11:31,306 --> 01:11:32,806
BB-8...

858
01:11:32,886 --> 01:11:33,966
No, you can't.

859
01:11:34,056 --> 01:11:36,226
You have to go back,
you're too important.

860
01:11:36,306 --> 01:11:37,476
They'll help you.

861
01:11:52,156 --> 01:11:53,446
I've had this for ages.

862
01:11:57,496 --> 01:11:58,826
Kept it locked away.

863
01:11:59,286 --> 01:12:00,286
Where'd you get that?

864
01:12:01,586 --> 01:12:04,666
A good question. For another time.

865
01:12:05,666 --> 01:12:06,756
Take it.

866
01:12:06,836 --> 01:12:08,336
Find your friend!

867
01:12:15,516 --> 01:12:17,516
Those beasts.

868
01:12:17,636 --> 01:12:18,636
They're here.

869
01:12:42,536 --> 01:12:45,206
<i>FN-41</i>7<i>, hold position.</i>

870
01:12:47,046 --> 01:12:48,716
Oh, safety.

871
01:13:14,406 --> 01:13:15,486
<i>Sir.</i>

872
01:13:15,576 --> 01:13:16,906
<i>The droid was spotted heading west.</i>

873
01:13:16,986 --> 01:13:17,996
<i>With a girl.</i>

874
01:13:23,536 --> 01:13:25,996
You have to keep going.
Stay out of sight.

875
01:13:26,086 --> 01:13:28,916
I'll try to fight them off.

876
01:13:29,006 --> 01:13:30,256
I hope so, too.

877
01:13:42,686 --> 01:13:44,606
Come on, Chewie!

878
01:13:47,016 --> 01:13:49,026
Rey and BB-8! They need you!

879
01:13:49,106 --> 01:13:50,106
Now! Go!

880
01:13:50,186 --> 01:13:52,526
I need a weapon!

881
01:13:52,606 --> 01:13:54,066
You have one!

882
01:14:03,456 --> 01:14:06,126
Hey, can I try that?

883
01:14:12,626 --> 01:14:14,086
I like this thing.

884
01:14:20,056 --> 01:14:21,346
<i>Traitor!</i>

885
01:15:06,096 --> 01:15:07,936
- You okay, Big Deal?
- Thanks.

886
01:15:08,016 --> 01:15:09,016
<i>Don't move.</i>

887
01:15:10,266 --> 01:15:12,026
<i>TK-338, we have targets in custody.</i>

888
01:15:18,196 --> 01:15:20,446
<i>We have incoming at 28. 6.</i>

889
01:15:20,526 --> 01:15:22,536
<i>Move! Move! Move!</i>

890
01:15:23,536 --> 01:15:26,536
<i>Scramble all squads, repeat,
scramble all squads!</i>

891
01:15:26,616 --> 01:15:28,376
<i>Head to higher cover and wait
for our position!</i>

892
01:15:31,206 --> 01:15:32,706
It's the Resistance.

893
01:15:40,546 --> 01:15:42,806
Go straight at them!
Don't let these dogs scare you!

894
01:15:42,886 --> 01:15:44,516
<i>- Copy that.</i>
<i>- We're with you, Poe.</i>

895
01:16:13,246 --> 01:16:14,246
Quick!

896
01:16:42,236 --> 01:16:44,536
Whoo! Yeah!

897
01:16:45,196 --> 01:16:47,036
That's one hell of a pilot!

898
01:16:47,196 --> 01:16:48,456
Whoo-hoo!

899
01:17:42,796 --> 01:17:44,846
<i>The girl I've heard so much about.</i>

900
01:17:57,106 --> 01:17:58,686
<i>The droid.</i>

901
01:18:00,356 --> 01:18:02,646
<i>Where is it?</i>

902
01:18:07,866 --> 01:18:09,496
<i>Request air support.</i>

903
01:18:16,626 --> 01:18:17,996
<i>The map.</i>

904
01:18:19,956 --> 01:18:22,126
<i>You've seen it.</i>

905
01:18:22,216 --> 01:18:24,546
<i>Sir, Resistance fighters.</i>

906
01:18:25,506 --> 01:18:27,096
<i>We need more troops.</i>

907
01:18:27,216 --> 01:18:29,056
<i>Pull the division out.</i>

908
01:18:29,176 --> 01:18:32,226
<i>Forget the droid.
We have what we need.</i>

909
01:18:39,066 --> 01:18:40,356
<i>Pull back to tree line!</i>

910
01:18:55,746 --> 01:18:57,286
No!

911
01:19:00,996 --> 01:19:02,416
No, no!

912
01:19:04,336 --> 01:19:06,426
No! No!

913
01:19:08,096 --> 01:19:09,426
Rey!

914
01:19:28,446 --> 01:19:30,446
He took her. Did you see that?

915
01:19:31,286 --> 01:19:32,696
He took her. She's gone.

916
01:19:32,786 --> 01:19:33,946
Yeah, I know.

917
01:19:43,296 --> 01:19:44,626
Let's go.

918
01:19:58,306 --> 01:20:00,806
Goodness! Han Solo!

919
01:20:00,936 --> 01:20:03,106
It is I, C-3PO.

920
01:20:03,646 --> 01:20:05,146
You probably don't recognize me...

921
01:20:05,316 --> 01:20:06,776
because of the red arm.

922
01:20:06,896 --> 01:20:08,816
Look who it is, did you see who...

923
01:20:10,616 --> 01:20:11,616
Uh...

924
01:20:12,156 --> 01:20:13,156
Hmm.

925
01:20:13,286 --> 01:20:16,326
Excuse me, Prin... General. Sorry.

926
01:20:16,406 --> 01:20:18,746
Come along, BB-8, quickly.

927
01:20:18,826 --> 01:20:21,496
Yes, I must get
my proper arm reinstalled.

928
01:20:23,416 --> 01:20:25,166
You changed your hair.

929
01:20:27,506 --> 01:20:28,926
Same jacket.

930
01:20:30,176 --> 01:20:31,966
No, new jacket.

931
01:20:44,936 --> 01:20:45,936
I saw him.

932
01:20:47,856 --> 01:20:50,026
Leia, I saw our son.

933
01:20:51,696 --> 01:20:52,986
He was here.

934
01:21:33,776 --> 01:21:34,776
Hey!

935
01:21:39,366 --> 01:21:41,246
BB-8, my buddy.

936
01:21:41,366 --> 01:21:43,326
Oh, it's so good to see you.

937
01:21:43,416 --> 01:21:44,416
Finn saved you?

938
01:21:44,496 --> 01:21:45,586
Where is he?

939
01:21:45,706 --> 01:21:46,916
Poe?

940
01:21:48,456 --> 01:21:49,456
Oh, no.

941
01:21:49,966 --> 01:21:51,506
Poe Dameron, you're alive?

942
01:21:51,586 --> 01:21:53,756
- Buddy! So are you!
- What happened to you?

943
01:21:53,836 --> 01:21:55,176
I got thrown from the crash.

944
01:21:55,256 --> 01:21:57,176
I woke up at night.
No you. No ship. Nothing.

945
01:21:57,256 --> 01:21:58,636
BB-8 says that you saved him.

946
01:21:58,766 --> 01:22:00,266
No, no, no. It wasn't just me.

947
01:22:00,386 --> 01:22:01,886
You completed my mission, Finn...

948
01:22:01,976 --> 01:22:02,976
That's my jacket.

949
01:22:03,146 --> 01:22:05,516
- Oh...
- No, no, no.

950
01:22:05,606 --> 01:22:07,356
Keep it. It suits you.

951
01:22:08,226 --> 01:22:09,986
You're a good man, Finn.

952
01:22:10,896 --> 01:22:12,856
Poe, I need your help.

953
01:22:14,406 --> 01:22:17,236
<i>PZ-4CO,
report to communications.</i>

954
01:22:20,326 --> 01:22:21,326
General Organa...

955
01:22:23,166 --> 01:22:25,286
I'm sorry to interrupt. This is Finn.

956
01:22:25,416 --> 01:22:28,246
- He needs to talk to you.
- And I need to talk to him.

957
01:22:28,336 --> 01:22:30,126
That was incredibly brave what you did.

958
01:22:30,206 --> 01:22:32,796
Renouncing the First Order,
saving this man's life.

959
01:22:32,916 --> 01:22:34,796
Thank you, ma'am. But a friend
of mine was taken prisoner.

960
01:22:34,926 --> 01:22:36,796
Han told me about the girl.

961
01:22:36,886 --> 01:22:38,006
I'm sorry.

962
01:22:38,136 --> 01:22:40,176
Finn's familiar with the weapon
that destroyed the Hosnian system.

963
01:22:40,266 --> 01:22:41,266
He worked on the base.

964
01:22:41,766 --> 01:22:43,686
We're desperate for anything
you can tell us.

965
01:22:43,806 --> 01:22:45,056
That's where my friend was taken.

966
01:22:45,146 --> 01:22:46,436
I've got to get there fast.

967
01:22:46,556 --> 01:22:48,016
And I will do everything I can to help...

968
01:22:48,106 --> 01:22:50,316
but first you need to tell us
all you know.

969
01:22:53,316 --> 01:22:55,026
That sounds very scary.

970
01:22:57,156 --> 01:22:59,276
You must be so brave.

971
01:23:02,116 --> 01:23:03,116
General...

972
01:23:03,246 --> 01:23:04,616
I regret to inform you...

973
01:23:04,706 --> 01:23:06,326
but this map recovered from BB-8...

974
01:23:06,416 --> 01:23:07,916
is only partially complete.

975
01:23:07,996 --> 01:23:11,756
And even worse, it matches
no charted system on record.

976
01:23:11,836 --> 01:23:13,966
We simply do not have
enough information...

977
01:23:14,046 --> 01:23:15,546
to locate Master Luke.

978
01:23:16,636 --> 01:23:18,636
Can't believe I was so foolish
to think I could find Luke...

979
01:23:18,716 --> 01:23:19,716
and bring him home.

980
01:23:19,846 --> 01:23:20,966
Leia.

981
01:23:21,056 --> 01:23:22,136
Don't do that.

982
01:23:22,216 --> 01:23:23,426
Do what?

983
01:23:23,516 --> 01:23:24,636
Anything.

984
01:23:26,056 --> 01:23:27,936
Princesses.

985
01:23:28,056 --> 01:23:29,606
I'm trying to be helpful.

986
01:23:30,766 --> 01:23:31,856
When did that ever help?

987
01:23:31,936 --> 01:23:33,646
And don't say the Death Star.

988
01:23:48,876 --> 01:23:49,876
BB-8.

989
01:23:49,996 --> 01:23:53,046
You're wasting your time.

990
01:23:53,126 --> 01:23:54,876
It is very doubtful that R2 would have

991
01:23:55,046 --> 01:23:56,216
the rest of the map in his backup data.

992
01:23:56,376 --> 01:23:58,506
I am afraid not.

993
01:23:58,586 --> 01:24:02,636
R2-D2 has been in low-power mode
ever since Master Luke went away.

994
01:24:05,226 --> 01:24:08,476
Sadly, he may never be
his old self again.

995
01:24:10,186 --> 01:24:11,816
Listen to me, will you?

996
01:24:12,816 --> 01:24:15,146
I know every time you...

997
01:24:17,356 --> 01:24:19,736
Every time you look at me
you're reminded of him.

998
01:24:19,816 --> 01:24:21,826
You think I want to forget him?

999
01:24:21,906 --> 01:24:23,576
I want him back.

1000
01:24:23,696 --> 01:24:25,786
There's nothing more we could
have done.

1001
01:24:27,536 --> 01:24:28,916
There's too much Vader in him.

1002
01:24:28,996 --> 01:24:31,916
That's why I wanted him
to train with Luke.

1003
01:24:31,996 --> 01:24:33,706
I just never should have sent him away.

1004
01:24:33,796 --> 01:24:35,376
That's when I lost him.

1005
01:24:36,626 --> 01:24:38,626
That's when I lost you both.

1006
01:24:40,716 --> 01:24:43,386
We both had to deal with it
in our own way.

1007
01:24:44,386 --> 01:24:47,346
I went back to the only thing
I was ever any good at.

1008
01:24:47,926 --> 01:24:49,136
We both did.

1009
01:24:51,346 --> 01:24:53,106
We lost our son.

1010
01:24:53,186 --> 01:24:54,356
Forever.

1011
01:24:54,436 --> 01:24:55,436
No.

1012
01:24:55,566 --> 01:24:57,106
It was Snoke.

1013
01:24:57,566 --> 01:25:00,196
He seduced our son to the dark side.

1014
01:25:00,276 --> 01:25:01,866
But we can still save him.

1015
01:25:02,566 --> 01:25:03,696
Me.

1016
01:25:04,616 --> 01:25:05,656
You.

1017
01:25:06,486 --> 01:25:08,826
If Luke couldn't reach him, how could I?

1018
01:25:08,906 --> 01:25:10,326
Luke is a Jedi.

1019
01:25:11,916 --> 01:25:13,246
You're his father.

1020
01:25:15,956 --> 01:25:19,756
There is still light in him, I know it.

1021
01:25:19,836 --> 01:25:21,546
General...

1022
01:25:21,636 --> 01:25:24,136
the reconnaissance report
on the enemy base is coming.

1023
01:25:50,956 --> 01:25:51,956
Where am I?

1024
01:25:54,286 --> 01:25:55,626
<i>You're my guest.</i>

1025
01:25:55,706 --> 01:25:57,046
Where are the others?

1026
01:25:57,126 --> 01:25:58,796
<i>Do you mean the murderers...</i>

1027
01:25:58,876 --> 01:26:01,756
<i>traitors, and thieves you call friends?</i>

1028
01:26:02,716 --> 01:26:05,176
<i>You'll be relieved to hear
I have no idea.</i>

1029
01:26:07,176 --> 01:26:09,266
<i>You still want to kill me.</i>

1030
01:26:10,056 --> 01:26:11,726
That happens
when you're being hunted...

1031
01:26:11,806 --> 01:26:13,726
by a creature in a mask.

1032
01:26:38,666 --> 01:26:40,506
Tell me about the droid.

1033
01:26:41,336 --> 01:26:43,166
He's a BB unit with a selenium drive...

1034
01:26:43,256 --> 01:26:44,586
and a thermal hyperscan vindicator.

1035
01:26:44,676 --> 01:26:46,796
It's carrying a section
of a navigational chart.

1036
01:26:46,886 --> 01:26:48,256
And we have the rest.

1037
01:26:48,346 --> 01:26:50,136
Recovered from the archives
of the Empire...

1038
01:26:50,216 --> 01:26:51,306
but we need the last piece.

1039
01:26:51,386 --> 01:26:53,846
And somehow you convinced
the droid to show it to you.

1040
01:26:55,476 --> 01:26:56,476
You.

1041
01:26:57,936 --> 01:26:59,186
A scavenger.

1042
01:27:01,526 --> 01:27:03,646
You know I can take whatever I want.

1043
01:27:09,776 --> 01:27:11,696
You're so lonely.

1044
01:27:13,706 --> 01:27:15,206
So afraid to leave.

1045
01:27:19,376 --> 01:27:22,296
At night, desperate to sleep.

1046
01:27:25,426 --> 01:27:27,006
You imagine an ocean.

1047
01:27:27,966 --> 01:27:29,256
I see it.

1048
01:27:30,506 --> 01:27:32,266
I see the island.

1049
01:27:36,846 --> 01:27:38,146
And Han Solo.

1050
01:27:40,476 --> 01:27:42,646
You feel like he's the father
you never had.

1051
01:27:43,276 --> 01:27:44,776
He would have disappointed you.

1052
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:46,196
Get out of my head.

1053
01:27:47,316 --> 01:27:48,866
I know you've seen the map.

1054
01:27:50,446 --> 01:27:51,616
It's in there.

1055
01:27:52,536 --> 01:27:53,786
And now you'll give it to me.

1056
01:28:02,416 --> 01:28:04,456
Don't be afraid. I feel it, too.

1057
01:28:06,926 --> 01:28:09,426
I'm not giving you anything.

1058
01:28:10,046 --> 01:28:11,136
We'll see.

1059
01:28:51,136 --> 01:28:52,136
You.

1060
01:28:53,216 --> 01:28:54,216
You're afraid.

1061
01:28:57,266 --> 01:29:00,186
That you will never be
as strong as Darth Vader.

1062
01:29:09,356 --> 01:29:11,196
<i>The scavenger...</i>

1063
01:29:11,316 --> 01:29:12,946
resisted you?

1064
01:29:13,026 --> 01:29:14,616
She is strong with the Force.

1065
01:29:14,696 --> 01:29:16,486
Untrained, but stronger than she knows.

1066
01:29:16,576 --> 01:29:17,786
And the droid?

1067
01:29:17,866 --> 01:29:21,206
Ren believed it was no longer
valuable to us.

1068
01:29:21,286 --> 01:29:23,916
That the girl was all we needed.

1069
01:29:24,036 --> 01:29:26,496
As a result, the droid has
most likely been returned...

1070
01:29:26,586 --> 01:29:27,706
to the hands of the enemy.

1071
01:29:27,836 --> 01:29:29,546
They may have the map already.

1072
01:29:29,626 --> 01:29:31,256
Then the Resistance
must be destroyed...

1073
01:29:31,376 --> 01:29:33,386
before they get to Skywalker.

1074
01:29:33,466 --> 01:29:35,346
We have their location.

1075
01:29:35,426 --> 01:29:38,056
We tracked their reconnaissance ship
to the Ileenium system.

1076
01:29:39,056 --> 01:29:40,346
Good.

1077
01:29:40,436 --> 01:29:43,306
Then we will crush them
once and for all.

1078
01:29:43,396 --> 01:29:45,146
Prepare the weapon.

1079
01:29:45,766 --> 01:29:48,566
Supreme Leader, I can get
the map from the girl.

1080
01:29:48,646 --> 01:29:50,446
I just need your guidance.

1081
01:29:52,066 --> 01:29:56,156
If what you say about this girl is true...

1082
01:29:56,776 --> 01:30:01,456
Bring her to me.

1083
01:30:15,426 --> 01:30:17,596
You will remove these restraints...

1084
01:30:17,676 --> 01:30:20,766
and leave this cell with the door open.

1085
01:30:24,516 --> 01:30:26,266
<i>What did you say?</i>

1086
01:30:29,186 --> 01:30:30,686
You will remove these restraints...

1087
01:30:30,776 --> 01:30:33,446
and leave this cell with the door open.

1088
01:30:40,286 --> 01:30:41,826
<i>I'll tighten
those restraints...</i>

1089
01:30:41,956 --> 01:30:43,996
<i>scavenger scum.</i>

1090
01:30:58,296 --> 01:30:59,886
You will remove these restraints...

1091
01:30:59,966 --> 01:31:02,346
and leave this cell with the door open.

1092
01:31:06,056 --> 01:31:07,646
<i>I will remove
these restraints...</i>

1093
01:31:07,726 --> 01:31:09,476
<i>and leave the cell with the door open.</i>

1094
01:31:18,406 --> 01:31:21,446
- And you'll drop your weapon.
<i>- And I'll drop my weapon.</i>

1095
01:31:34,166 --> 01:31:35,256
<i>No.</i>

1096
01:31:36,256 --> 01:31:37,256
<i>No.</i>

1097
01:31:39,176 --> 01:31:40,306
<i>Guards!</i>

1098
01:31:42,846 --> 01:31:43,846
<i>Guards!</i>

1099
01:31:48,856 --> 01:31:51,106
Begin charging the weapon.

1100
01:31:51,186 --> 01:31:52,526
Yes, sir.

1101
01:31:52,606 --> 01:31:53,896
Weapon charging.

1102
01:32:13,166 --> 01:32:15,166
The scan data from Snap's
reconnaissance flight...

1103
01:32:15,256 --> 01:32:16,586
confirms Finn's report.

1104
01:32:16,716 --> 01:32:18,676
They've somehow created
a hyper-lightspeed weapon...

1105
01:32:18,756 --> 01:32:20,046
built within the planet itself.

1106
01:32:20,216 --> 01:32:21,176
A laser cannon?

1107
01:32:21,256 --> 01:32:23,096
We're not sure how to describe
a weapon of this scale.

1108
01:32:23,216 --> 01:32:24,216
It's another Death Star.

1109
01:32:24,306 --> 01:32:26,056
I wish that were the case, Major.

1110
01:32:26,136 --> 01:32:27,386
This was the Death Star.

1111
01:32:30,146 --> 01:32:32,646
And this is Starkiller Base.

1112
01:32:33,146 --> 01:32:34,316
So, it's big.

1113
01:32:34,396 --> 01:32:37,486
How is it possible to power
a weapon of that size?

1114
01:32:37,606 --> 01:32:39,736
It uses the power of the sun.

1115
01:32:40,946 --> 01:32:42,116
As the weapon is charged...

1116
01:32:42,236 --> 01:32:44,326
the sun is drained until it disappears.

1117
01:32:44,406 --> 01:32:45,406
Ma'am.

1118
01:32:47,406 --> 01:32:48,456
The First Order...

1119
01:32:48,576 --> 01:32:49,996
they're charging the weapon again now.

1120
01:32:50,956 --> 01:32:52,836
Our system is the next target.

1121
01:32:52,956 --> 01:32:53,956
Oh, my.

1122
01:32:54,046 --> 01:32:55,546
Without the Republic fleet,
we're doomed.

1123
01:32:55,626 --> 01:32:57,416
Okay. How do we blow it up?

1124
01:32:57,506 --> 01:32:59,836
- There's always a way to do that.
- Han's right.

1125
01:32:59,926 --> 01:33:01,586
In order
for that amount of power...

1126
01:33:01,676 --> 01:33:03,046
to be contained...

1127
01:33:03,136 --> 01:33:05,096
that base has to have some
kind of thermal oscillator.

1128
01:33:05,216 --> 01:33:07,386
There is one. Precinct 47.

1129
01:33:07,976 --> 01:33:09,226
Here.

1130
01:33:09,306 --> 01:33:11,266
If we can destroy
that oscillator...

1131
01:33:11,396 --> 01:33:14,356
it might destabilize the core
and cripple the weapon.

1132
01:33:14,436 --> 01:33:16,226
- Maybe the planet.
- We'll go in there,

1133
01:33:16,316 --> 01:33:17,646
we'll hit that oscillator
with everything we've got.

1134
01:33:17,776 --> 01:33:19,106
They have defensive shields...

1135
01:33:19,196 --> 01:33:21,156
that our ships cannot penetrate.

1136
01:33:21,276 --> 01:33:22,696
We disable the shields.

1137
01:33:22,776 --> 01:33:24,446
Kid, you worked there.

1138
01:33:24,576 --> 01:33:25,576
What do you got?

1139
01:33:25,656 --> 01:33:26,866
I can do it.

1140
01:33:26,946 --> 01:33:28,196
I like this guy.

1141
01:33:28,326 --> 01:33:30,206
I can disable the shields,
but I have to be there.

1142
01:33:30,286 --> 01:33:31,746
On the planet.

1143
01:33:31,826 --> 01:33:33,456
- We'll get you there.
- Han, how?

1144
01:33:34,206 --> 01:33:35,706
If I told you, you wouldn't like it.

1145
01:33:35,836 --> 01:33:37,706
So we disable the shields...

1146
01:33:37,796 --> 01:33:40,086
we take out the oscillator
and we blow up their big gun.

1147
01:33:40,216 --> 01:33:42,296
All right. Let's go.

1148
01:34:04,816 --> 01:34:06,326
Chewie, check that donal capitator.

1149
01:34:06,406 --> 01:34:07,906
Come on. Let's go.

1150
01:34:07,986 --> 01:34:10,196
Finn, be careful with those.
They're explosives.

1151
01:34:10,326 --> 01:34:11,366
Now you tell me?

1152
01:34:11,496 --> 01:34:14,706
You know, no matter
how much we fought...

1153
01:34:16,126 --> 01:34:18,456
I've always hated watching you leave.

1154
01:34:18,546 --> 01:34:19,756
That's why I did it.

1155
01:34:21,006 --> 01:34:22,506
So you'd miss me.

1156
01:34:25,256 --> 01:34:27,046
I did miss you.

1157
01:34:28,506 --> 01:34:30,306
It wasn't all bad, was it?

1158
01:34:30,386 --> 01:34:31,476
Huh?

1159
01:34:31,556 --> 01:34:34,686
Some of it was... good.

1160
01:34:34,846 --> 01:34:36,516
Pretty good.

1161
01:34:39,856 --> 01:34:42,736
- Some things never change.
- True.

1162
01:34:43,276 --> 01:34:45,276
You still drive me crazy.

1163
01:34:54,456 --> 01:34:56,376
If you see our son...

1164
01:34:58,876 --> 01:35:00,546
bring him home.

1165
01:35:05,966 --> 01:35:08,636
<i>Sir, sensors
triggered in Hangar</i> 7<i>18.</i>

1166
01:35:08,716 --> 01:35:10,386
<i>We're searching the area.</i>

1167
01:35:10,466 --> 01:35:12,596
<i>She's just beginning
to test her powers.</i>

1168
01:35:12,726 --> 01:35:14,386
<i>The longer it takes to find her...</i>

1169
01:35:14,476 --> 01:35:16,146
<i>the more dangerous she becomes.</i>

1170
01:35:21,226 --> 01:35:22,856
<i>All sentry droids...</i>

1171
01:35:22,936 --> 01:35:24,146
<i>all sentry droids...</i>

1172
01:35:24,236 --> 01:35:26,486
<i>resynchronize
to Galactic Standard Time.</i>

1173
01:35:26,566 --> 01:35:28,566
<i>Offset 4</i>7<i>3.</i>

1174
01:35:31,326 --> 01:35:32,406
How are we getting in?

1175
01:35:32,536 --> 01:35:34,496
Their shields have
a fractional refresh rate.

1176
01:35:34,576 --> 01:35:36,246
Keeps anything traveling
slower than lightspeed...

1177
01:35:36,416 --> 01:35:37,746
from getting through.

1178
01:35:38,326 --> 01:35:40,416
We're making our landing
approach at lightspeed?

1179
01:35:41,876 --> 01:35:42,956
Chewie, get ready.

1180
01:35:44,256 --> 01:35:45,416
And... Now!

1181
01:35:49,346 --> 01:35:51,006
I am pulling up!

1182
01:35:57,726 --> 01:35:59,356
I get any higher...

1183
01:35:59,436 --> 01:36:00,686
they'll see us!

1184
01:36:22,626 --> 01:36:25,006
Sir, she was
not found in Hangar 718.

1185
01:36:25,126 --> 01:36:26,216
But all troops are on alert.

1186
01:36:26,296 --> 01:36:27,676
<i>Put every hangar on lockdown.</i>

1187
01:36:27,796 --> 01:36:29,466
<i>She's going to try to steal
a ship to esc...</i>

1188
01:36:32,096 --> 01:36:33,636
<i>Han Solo.</i>

1189
01:36:44,856 --> 01:36:46,566
The flooding tunnel is over that ridge.

1190
01:36:46,646 --> 01:36:47,896
We'll get in that way.

1191
01:36:47,986 --> 01:36:49,906
What was your job
when you were based here?

1192
01:36:49,986 --> 01:36:50,986
Sanitation.

1193
01:36:53,866 --> 01:36:55,576
Sanitation?

1194
01:36:55,656 --> 01:36:57,366
Then how do you know
how to disable the shields?

1195
01:36:57,496 --> 01:36:58,496
I don't.

1196
01:36:58,616 --> 01:37:00,366
I'm just here to get Rey.

1197
01:37:00,496 --> 01:37:04,086
People are counting on us.
The galaxy is counting on us.

1198
01:37:04,166 --> 01:37:05,496
Solo, we'll figure it out.

1199
01:37:06,456 --> 01:37:07,876
We'll use the Force.

1200
01:37:08,006 --> 01:37:10,086
That's not how the Force works.

1201
01:37:11,676 --> 01:37:14,216
Oh, really? You're cold?

1202
01:37:14,386 --> 01:37:15,386
Come on.

1203
01:37:22,806 --> 01:37:24,106
Report.

1204
01:37:24,186 --> 01:37:26,396
Weapon charged in 15 minutes, sir.

1205
01:37:28,856 --> 01:37:29,856
<i>Hey!</i>

1206
01:37:33,026 --> 01:37:35,236
The longer we're here
the less luck we're gonna have.

1207
01:37:35,366 --> 01:37:37,866
- The shields.
- I have an idea about that.

1208
01:37:45,836 --> 01:37:48,296
- You remember me?
<i>- FN-218</i>7.

1209
01:37:48,376 --> 01:37:49,626
Not anymore.

1210
01:37:49,796 --> 01:37:51,126
The name's Finn and I'm in charge.

1211
01:37:51,216 --> 01:37:53,256
I'm in charge now, Phasma.
I'm in charge.

1212
01:37:53,336 --> 01:37:55,346
- Bring it down. Bring it down.
- Yeah.

1213
01:37:55,426 --> 01:37:56,556
Follow me.

1214
01:38:09,736 --> 01:38:11,196
<i>Have you
checked out the new T-1</i>7<i>s?</i>

1215
01:38:11,276 --> 01:38:12,946
<i>The T-1</i>7<i>s,
as far as I can tell...</i>

1216
01:38:13,066 --> 01:38:14,116
<i>are a great improvement.</i>

1217
01:38:14,236 --> 01:38:16,076
<i>Yeah.
That's what they tell you.</i>

1218
01:38:16,196 --> 01:38:17,406
<i>But believe me, they don't hold up.</i>

1219
01:38:17,536 --> 01:38:19,036
<i>- They don't?
- No.</i>

1220
01:38:54,736 --> 01:38:56,486
You want me to blast
that bucket off your head?

1221
01:38:56,566 --> 01:38:57,696
Lower the shields.

1222
01:38:57,776 --> 01:38:59,616
<i>You're making a big mistake.</i>

1223
01:38:59,736 --> 01:39:01,826
Do it.

1224
01:39:06,076 --> 01:39:07,206
Solo, if this works...

1225
01:39:07,286 --> 01:39:09,546
we're not gonna have
a lot of time to find Rey.

1226
01:39:09,626 --> 01:39:11,006
Don't worry, kid.

1227
01:39:11,796 --> 01:39:13,216
We won't leave here without her.

1228
01:39:15,006 --> 01:39:17,886
<i>You can't be so stupid
as to think this will be easy.</i>

1229
01:39:17,966 --> 01:39:20,556
<i>My troops will storm
this block and kill you all.</i>

1230
01:39:20,636 --> 01:39:22,476
I disagree. What do we do with her?

1231
01:39:23,096 --> 01:39:24,636
Is there a garbage chute?

1232
01:39:25,306 --> 01:39:26,646
Trash compactor?

1233
01:39:27,806 --> 01:39:28,896
Yeah, there is.

1234
01:39:29,226 --> 01:39:30,776
General, their shields are down.

1235
01:39:30,856 --> 01:39:32,436
Thank the Maker!

1236
01:39:32,526 --> 01:39:34,276
Han did it. Send them in.

1237
01:39:34,356 --> 01:39:36,276
Give Poe full authorization for attack.

1238
01:39:36,356 --> 01:39:38,656
Black Leader,
go to sub-lights on your call.

1239
01:39:38,736 --> 01:39:39,736
Roger, base.

1240
01:39:39,826 --> 01:39:41,536
Red squad, Blue squad, take my lead.

1241
01:39:41,736 --> 01:39:43,746
Dropping out of lightspeed.

1242
01:39:57,506 --> 01:39:59,006
<i>Almost in range.</i>

1243
01:39:59,176 --> 01:40:01,926
Hit the target dead center.
As many runs as we can get.

1244
01:40:02,006 --> 01:40:03,886
Approaching target.

1245
01:40:07,846 --> 01:40:09,306
Fighters incoming!

1246
01:40:10,186 --> 01:40:11,766
<i>Coming at 28.336.</i>

1247
01:40:11,856 --> 01:40:13,646
Forty-five!
Shields up! Shields up!

1248
01:40:13,726 --> 01:40:15,396
Dispatch all squadrons.

1249
01:40:15,526 --> 01:40:17,026
Yes, General.

1250
01:40:17,856 --> 01:40:18,856
All right. Let's light it up.

1251
01:40:28,616 --> 01:40:30,706
- Ah, direct hit.
- But no damage!

1252
01:40:30,786 --> 01:40:32,036
<i>Yeah, we gotta
keep hitting it.</i>

1253
01:40:32,206 --> 01:40:33,496
Another bombing run.

1254
01:40:33,626 --> 01:40:36,336
<i>Remember, when the sun is gone
that weapon will be ready to fire.</i>

1255
01:40:36,416 --> 01:40:39,006
But as long as there's light,
we got a chance.

1256
01:40:40,716 --> 01:40:42,256
Guys, we got a lot of company!

1257
01:40:48,886 --> 01:40:50,516
<i>We think
they may be splitting up.</i>

1258
01:40:50,596 --> 01:40:52,566
<i>Heading to quadrants 4 and 5.</i>

1259
01:41:00,406 --> 01:41:02,406
We'll use the charges
to blow that blast door.

1260
01:41:02,486 --> 01:41:05,236
I'll go in and draw fire,
but I'm gonna need cover.

1261
01:41:05,326 --> 01:41:06,406
You sure you're up for this?

1262
01:41:06,496 --> 01:41:07,706
Hell, no.

1263
01:41:07,786 --> 01:41:09,076
I'll go in and try to find Rey.

1264
01:41:09,156 --> 01:41:10,366
The troopers will be on our tail.

1265
01:41:10,456 --> 01:41:12,586
We have to be ready for that.

1266
01:41:12,666 --> 01:41:14,456
There's an access tunnel that leads...

1267
01:41:14,546 --> 01:41:17,086
Why are you doing that? Hmm?
Why are you doing this?

1268
01:41:17,166 --> 01:41:18,506
I'm trying to come up with a plan.

1269
01:41:35,226 --> 01:41:36,816
You all right?

1270
01:41:36,896 --> 01:41:38,526
- Yeah.
- Good.

1271
01:41:38,606 --> 01:41:40,196
What happened to you?
Did he hurt you?

1272
01:41:40,276 --> 01:41:41,656
Finn, what are you doing here?

1273
01:41:41,776 --> 01:41:43,866
We came back for you.

1274
01:41:44,736 --> 01:41:46,286
What'd he say?

1275
01:41:46,366 --> 01:41:47,746
That it was your idea.

1276
01:41:51,536 --> 01:41:52,626
Thank you.

1277
01:41:56,496 --> 01:41:58,086
How did you get away?

1278
01:41:58,166 --> 01:41:59,206
I can't explain it.

1279
01:41:59,296 --> 01:42:01,376
And you wouldn't believe it.

1280
01:42:01,466 --> 01:42:03,796
Escape now, hug later.

1281
01:42:18,976 --> 01:42:20,526
I got one behind me.

1282
01:42:20,646 --> 01:42:22,026
<i>- You see it?</i>
- Yeah. I'm on it.

1283
01:42:30,656 --> 01:42:32,496
- Burillo's been hit.
- Watch out for ground fire.

1284
01:42:37,416 --> 01:42:39,376
They're in trouble.

1285
01:42:39,456 --> 01:42:40,876
We can't leave.

1286
01:42:42,676 --> 01:42:45,676
My friend's got a bag full of explosives.

1287
01:42:45,756 --> 01:42:47,426
Let's use them.

1288
01:42:47,506 --> 01:42:48,886
General, are you seeing this?

1289
01:42:49,006 --> 01:42:50,346
Two more X-wings down.

1290
01:42:50,426 --> 01:42:52,806
That's half our fleet destroyed.

1291
01:42:52,886 --> 01:42:55,556
And their weapon
will be fully charged in ten minutes.

1292
01:42:55,646 --> 01:42:57,766
It would take a miracle to save us now.

1293
01:43:24,216 --> 01:43:25,216
Ah.

1294
01:43:25,296 --> 01:43:27,636
Girl knows her stuff.

1295
01:43:36,596 --> 01:43:39,056
We'll set the charges
against every other column.

1296
01:43:40,266 --> 01:43:42,226
You're right. That's a better idea.

1297
01:43:42,316 --> 01:43:44,316
You take the top. I'll go down below.

1298
01:43:44,396 --> 01:43:46,066
Detonator.

1299
01:43:46,156 --> 01:43:47,816
We'll meet back here.

1300
01:44:33,236 --> 01:44:34,236
<i>Find them.</i>

1301
01:45:36,006 --> 01:45:37,016
Ben!

1302
01:45:49,776 --> 01:45:50,896
<i>Han Solo.</i>

1303
01:45:51,606 --> 01:45:54,486
<i>I've been waiting for this day
for a long time.</i>

1304
01:46:13,756 --> 01:46:17,256
Take off that mask. You don't need it.

1305
01:46:17,846 --> 01:46:19,726
<i>What do you think you'll see if I do?</i>

1306
01:46:19,846 --> 01:46:22,096
The face of my son.

1307
01:46:43,956 --> 01:46:46,126
Your son is gone.

1308
01:46:47,416 --> 01:46:49,756
He was weak and foolish like his father.

1309
01:46:49,916 --> 01:46:51,666
So I destroyed him.

1310
01:46:53,756 --> 01:46:56,136
That's what Snoke wants you to believe.

1311
01:46:57,386 --> 01:46:59,096
But it's not true.

1312
01:47:00,426 --> 01:47:02,516
My son is alive.

1313
01:47:02,596 --> 01:47:04,056
No.

1314
01:47:04,136 --> 01:47:06,356
The Supreme Leader is wise.

1315
01:47:06,436 --> 01:47:09,186
Snoke is using you for your power.

1316
01:47:09,266 --> 01:47:11,066
When he gets what he wants,
he'll crush you.

1317
01:47:16,316 --> 01:47:17,986
You know it's true.

1318
01:47:23,616 --> 01:47:24,616
It's too late.

1319
01:47:24,706 --> 01:47:26,286
No, it's not.

1320
01:47:26,376 --> 01:47:28,126
Leave here with me. Come home.

1321
01:47:29,876 --> 01:47:31,296
We miss you.

1322
01:47:40,006 --> 01:47:42,136
I'm being torn apart.

1323
01:47:44,976 --> 01:47:47,146
I want to be free of this pain.

1324
01:47:52,566 --> 01:47:53,606
I know what I have to do...

1325
01:47:53,686 --> 01:47:55,816
but I don't know if I have
the strength to do it.

1326
01:47:59,736 --> 01:48:00,826
Will you help me?

1327
01:48:00,906 --> 01:48:02,736
Yes. Anything.

1328
01:48:51,036 --> 01:48:53,876
No!

1329
01:49:00,796 --> 01:49:02,046
Thank you.

1330
01:49:09,556 --> 01:49:10,556
No.

1331
01:50:25,886 --> 01:50:27,466
The oscillator's been damaged...

1332
01:50:27,556 --> 01:50:29,306
but is still functional.

1333
01:50:29,386 --> 01:50:31,886
Admiral, their weapon
will fire in two minutes.

1334
01:50:43,156 --> 01:50:44,606
The <i>Falcon's</i> this way.

1335
01:51:05,506 --> 01:51:06,846
We're not done yet.

1336
01:51:10,016 --> 01:51:11,846
You're a monster.

1337
01:51:11,976 --> 01:51:13,846
It's just us now.

1338
01:51:15,016 --> 01:51:16,516
Han Solo can't save you.

1339
01:51:25,316 --> 01:51:27,116
Rey!

1340
01:51:29,906 --> 01:51:31,406
Rey.

1341
01:51:31,496 --> 01:51:32,496
Rey!

1342
01:51:34,326 --> 01:51:35,956
Oh, no. No, no.

1343
01:51:36,036 --> 01:51:37,036
Rey.

1344
01:51:39,246 --> 01:51:40,796
Traitor!

1345
01:51:51,346 --> 01:51:52,886
That lightsaber.

1346
01:51:54,016 --> 01:51:55,056
It belongs to me.

1347
01:51:55,136 --> 01:51:56,806
Come get it.

1348
01:53:44,626 --> 01:53:45,706
We just lost <i>R-1.</i>

1349
01:53:46,336 --> 01:53:47,626
<i>We're overwhelmed.</i>

1350
01:53:47,706 --> 01:53:49,006
What do we do? It isn't working.

1351
01:53:49,756 --> 01:53:51,966
Black Leader, there's a brand
new hole in that oscillator.

1352
01:53:53,006 --> 01:53:54,926
<i>Looks like our friends got in.</i>

1353
01:53:55,556 --> 01:53:57,426
Red Four, Red Six, cover us.

1354
01:53:57,516 --> 01:53:58,676
- I'm on it.
- Roger.

1355
01:53:58,766 --> 01:54:00,306
Everybody else, hit the target hard.

1356
01:54:00,386 --> 01:54:01,436
Give it everything you got.

1357
01:54:14,316 --> 01:54:15,696
I need some help here.
I need some help!

1358
01:54:15,776 --> 01:54:17,036
- Coming in!
- Watch out!

1359
01:54:18,236 --> 01:54:19,496
I'm hit!

1360
01:54:24,996 --> 01:54:26,916
All teams, I'm going in.

1361
01:54:27,046 --> 01:54:28,206
<i>Pull up and cover me.</i>

1362
01:54:28,296 --> 01:54:30,046
Copy that, Black Leader.
Good luck, Poe.

1363
01:54:36,176 --> 01:54:38,056
Weapon fully charged in 30 seconds.

1364
01:54:39,556 --> 01:54:40,726
Prepare to fire.

1365
01:56:13,816 --> 01:56:15,236
You need a teacher.

1366
01:56:17,106 --> 01:56:18,906
I could show you the ways of the Force.

1367
01:56:21,526 --> 01:56:22,616
The Force?

1368
01:58:11,386 --> 01:58:12,806
All eyes on that TIE fighter.

1369
01:58:12,896 --> 01:58:14,476
We're losing power rapidly!

1370
01:58:16,856 --> 01:58:18,776
Lieutenant!
Get back to your station!

1371
01:58:18,856 --> 01:58:22,156
Just look! We won't survive.
Even Hux is gone.

1372
01:58:22,276 --> 01:58:23,776
Supreme Leader.

1373
01:58:24,656 --> 01:58:26,616
The fuel cells have ruptured.

1374
01:58:26,696 --> 01:58:28,826
The collapse of the planet has begun.

1375
01:58:29,036 --> 01:58:33,076
Leave the base at once
and come to me with Kylo Ren.

1376
01:58:34,166 --> 01:58:36,036
It is time...

1377
01:58:36,126 --> 01:58:38,456
to complete his training.

1378
01:58:40,796 --> 01:58:41,796
Finn!

1379
01:58:42,546 --> 01:58:43,756
Finn.

1380
01:59:32,886 --> 01:59:35,976
- All teams, I got eyes on them.
- Yes!

1381
01:59:58,916 --> 02:00:02,046
Our job's done here. Let's go home.

1382
02:00:17,226 --> 02:00:19,556
Easy, easy. He's hurt.

1383
02:00:19,686 --> 02:00:20,896
We've got a heartbeat.

1384
02:01:22,956 --> 02:01:24,586
R2-D2!

1385
02:01:25,456 --> 02:01:26,456
You've come back.

1386
02:01:30,426 --> 02:01:31,836
You found what?

1387
02:01:31,966 --> 02:01:33,966
How dare you call me that!

1388
02:01:36,346 --> 02:01:38,426
Find Master Luke, how?

1389
02:01:38,516 --> 02:01:39,556
Come, R2.

1390
02:01:39,636 --> 02:01:41,646
We must go tell the others at once!

1391
02:01:42,976 --> 02:01:44,066
General.

1392
02:01:44,146 --> 02:01:46,316
Excuse me, General.

1393
02:01:50,906 --> 02:01:53,406
R2 may contain some
much-needed good news.

1394
02:01:54,076 --> 02:01:55,536
Tell me.

1395
02:02:05,916 --> 02:02:07,336
Yeah. All right, buddy. Hold on.

1396
02:02:21,766 --> 02:02:23,396
The map, it is complete.

1397
02:02:24,016 --> 02:02:25,686
Luke.

1398
02:02:25,766 --> 02:02:27,356
Oh, my dear friend...

1399
02:02:27,476 --> 02:02:29,026
how I've missed you.

1400
02:02:45,996 --> 02:02:48,046
We'll see each other again.

1401
02:02:48,126 --> 02:02:50,046
I believe that.

1402
02:02:58,216 --> 02:03:00,016
Thank you, my friend.

1403
02:03:14,906 --> 02:03:16,736
Rey.

1404
02:03:18,406 --> 02:03:21,196
May the Force be with you.

1405
02:03:24,196 --> 02:03:28,196
